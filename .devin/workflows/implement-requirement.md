# CROW - Implement Requirement Flow

Use this workflow when picking up an item from
`doc/backlog/backlog.md`. The index lists each requirement
(`R**`) with a brief intro and a link to its detail doc
(`doc/backlog/R**-<component>-<topic>.md`). Open the matched detail doc for the
full problem/approach/files/acceptance analysis. Each item follows the
full lifecycle below.

## Lifecycle

```
1. Understand       → Read relevant code + design docs, confirm the problem
2. Design           → Write doc/working/design-<topic>.md
                      - Problem statement + current behavior
                      - Proposed approach + alternatives considered
                      - Acceptance test plan (what tests prove it works)
3. Plan             → Write doc/working/plan-<topic>.md
                      - Task breakdown with checkboxes
                      - File-level changes
                      - Dependency ordering
                      - Track progress here
4. Implement        → Code changes per plan, run tests per acceptance criteria
5. Commit           → Commit all code + tests + working docs (design draft, plan doc)
                      This checkpoint preserves work in git history in case of
                      later blocking or human intervention.
6. Affected tests   → Run only the test commands touched by this requirement's
                      changes (see Test Commands below). Pick the subset matching
                      the changed crates/components (e.g. crow-kv changes →
                      test-kv-core + test-kv-server). Every selected test must
                      pass — no failure may be skipped. The full suite runs
                      later in Step 9 as a safety net.
7. Merge design     → Fold the design doc into the formal design doc it belongs
                      to (e.g. design-crow-tree-engine.md, design-wal.md),
                      following that doc's style and detail level. Delete the
                      standalone working/design-<topic>.md.
8. Cleanup          → Delete the requirement's detail doc
                      doc/backlog/R**-<component>-<topic>.md and remove its entry
                      from the Item Index in doc/backlog/backlog.md. Delete
                      plan-<topic>.md and design-<topic>.md.
                      → Commit cleanup (second and final commit)
9. Local CI check   → Run the GitHub CI Test job steps locally to verify they
                      pass before pushing:
                      - pixi run cargo fmt --all -- --check
                      - pixi run cargo clippy --all-targets -- -D warnings
                      - All Test Commands below, each separately so pass/fail
                        is visible per command. All must pass — if any fail,
                        fix before pushing.
```

## Test Commands

Each test command should be run with a preceding `clean-env` to reset
test state:

- `pixi run clean-env && pixi run test-tree-ct`
- `pixi run clean-env && pixi run test-tree-ffi`
- `pixi run clean-env && pixi run test-kv-core`
- `pixi run clean-env && pixi run test-kv-server`
- `pixi run clean-env && pixi run test-console-cli`
- `pixi run clean-env && pixi run test-console-server`
- `pixi run clean-env && pixi run test-console-ui`

Step 6 runs the subset affected by the changes; Step 9 runs all of them.

## Blocking Conditions

The workflow runs autonomously end-to-end. Stop and ask the user only in
the following two cases:

### 1. Design gap requiring human decision

During Step 2 (Design) or Step 3 (Plan), if there is an architectural
decision with multiple valid approaches and no clearly superior choice,
append the gap to the end of `doc/working/plan-<topic>.md` under a
`## Blocked` heading with:

- The decision that needs to be made.
- The alternatives considered and their trade-offs.
- Why it cannot be resolved automatically.

Commit the plan doc with the gap recorded, then stop and wait for human
review.

### 2. Test failure after 5 retries

During Step 4 (Implement), Step 6 (Affected tests), or Step 9 (Local CI
check), if a test fails (new or existing regression) and remains failing
after 5 retry attempts, append to the end of
`doc/working/plan-<topic>.md` under a `## Blocked` heading with:

- The failing test name(s) and command to reproduce.
- What was attempted in each retry.
- Preliminary root-cause analysis.
- The exact error output.

Commit current work, then stop and wait for human intervention. Do not
guess fixes or weaken tests.

In all other cases, proceed autonomously through all nine steps.

## Design doc style (from existing design docs)

- **Problem-first**: state what's broken/missing before proposing solutions
- **Alternatives**: list rejected approaches with rationale
- **Code-grounded**: reference actual file paths, function names, line numbers
- **Concise**: aim for the detail level of existing §-level content in
  `design/design-crow-tree-engine.md` or `design/design-crow-tree-storage.md`
- **Acceptance criteria**: concrete, testable conditions

## Plan doc style

- Task breakdown as `- [ ]` checkboxes
- One task in progress at a time
- File list with intended changes
- Test checklist
- Update `doc/doc_index.md` if a new formal doc is added (not for working docs)

## Commit Cadence

The workflow produces at least **two commits** per requirement:

1. **Implementation commits** (during Step 4) — commit after each task in the
   plan completes. For small tasks a single commit covering multiple tasks is
   fine; for large or independent tasks, one commit per task keeps the history
   reviewable. Use judgment based on task type and change size. The final
   implementation commit includes the design draft and plan doc, preserving
   the full working state in git history.
2. **Cleanup commit** (after Step 8) — merged design doc, deletion of
   working docs, deletion of `R**-<component>-<topic>.md` and its index entry in
   `backlog.md`.

All commits must pass the pre-commit quality gate (fmt, clippy, tests).
