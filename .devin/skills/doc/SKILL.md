# CROW Documentation Structure

## Entry Point

**Always start at `doc/doc_index.md`** — one-line pointers to every doc and section. Open detailed docs only when the index row matches the task.

## Hierarchy

```
doc_index.md                                (table of contents — the only file at doc root)
design/
    ├── {kv,tree,console,diskdb,protocol}/  (one subdir per component area)
    │   ├── design-crow-<area>.md           (root design for that area)
    │   ├── design-crow-<area>-<topic>.md   (sub-design docs)
    │   └── kv-{read,scan,write}-flow-analysis.md  (KV only: long-lived flow analyses)
user-manual/
    ├── user-guide.md                       (user guide: Web UI, CLI, REST API)
    ├── user-guide.html                     (build artifact — do not hand-edit)
    └── build_html.py                       (MD → HTML converter with tabs)
backlog/
    ├── backlog.md                          (backlog index: R** list with brief intros)
    └── R**-<component>-<topic>.md          (per-requirement detail, deleted after merge)
working/
    ├── plan-<topic>.md                     (task plans, deleted after merge)
    └── design-<topic>.md                   (design drafts, deleted after merge)
```

## Naming

- **Sub-design docs** — `design-crow-<area>-<topic>.md`, `lowercase-kebab-case`. Example: `design/kv/design-crow-kv-wal.md`.
- **Backlog requirements** — `R**-<component>-<topic>.md`, where `<component>` is the owning crate/area (`kv`, `tree`, `console`, `client`, `server`, `diskdb`). A requirement is prefixed by the component that owns the work, not every component it touches — cross-component requirements take the prefix of the primary owner. See [`doc-backlog`](doc-backlog.md) for the full doc structure.

## Flow-Analysis Docs

`kv-read-flow-analysis.md` / `kv-scan-flow-analysis.md` / `kv-write-flow-analysis.md` — long-lived per-path flow traces, benchmark results, and open issues. Not deleted after a single requirement. Live under `doc/design/kv/` (not `doc/working/`) because they are permanent design references.

## Core Rules

1. **Index first** — read `doc/doc_index.md` before opening any other doc; update it in the same commit when you add, rename, delete, or re-scope a doc. One row per doc with a short "when to read" phrase.
2. **No upstream violations** — fix the root design doc (`design/<area>/design-crow-<area>.md`) first if a gap is found.
3. **Single source of truth** — architecture and rationale in `design/<area>/design-crow-<area>.md`, detailed design in `design/<area>/design-crow-<area>-<topic>.md`, user operations in `user-manual/user-guide.md`.
4. **Traceability** — every doc links upstream via section anchors.
5. **Sub-topic split** — when a design topic exceeds ~200 lines or has independent phases, create `design/<area>/design-crow-<area>-<topic>.md` and add a row to `doc_index.md`.
6. **No temp docs in `doc_index.md`** — the index tracks long-lived permanent docs only. Backlog and working docs are self-indexed.
7. **Working doc hygiene** — delete `plan-<topic>.md` and `design-<topic>.md` when the effort is complete.
8. **Raw-readable formatting** — docs are read as raw markdown most times, not rendered. Prefer definition lists or nested bullets. Tables only for data/metric comparison; `doc_index.md` always uses tables.
9. **Design docs describe current state, not change history** — no "pre-R**", "post-R**", "legacy", "supersedes", "before/after" narratives. No R-number references — backlog docs are deleted, making them dead links. Change history belongs in commit messages.
10. **Rebuild HTML when user-guide.md changes** — run `python3 doc/user-manual/build_html.py` in the same commit. Never hand-edit `user-guide.html` or use other markdown tools.

## Doc Guides

Detailed writing guides for each doc kind. Open the matched guide before writing or revising that doc type:

- **Formal design doc** (`doc/design/<area>/design-crow-<area>(-<topic>)?.md`) — see [`doc-design`](doc-design.md). Permanent, human-readable design record (root + sub-design); the target when folding working drafts back in.
- **Backlog requirement doc** (`doc/backlog/R**-<component>-<topic>.md`) — see [`doc-backlog`](doc-backlog.md). Structure: Problem → Solution → Dependencies → Acceptance.
- **Design draft** (`doc/working/design-<topic>.md`) — see [`doc-working-design`](doc-working-design.md). Implementation detail (with Scope + Complexity) that gets folded into the formal design doc and deleted after merge.
- **Task plan** (`doc/working/plan-<topic>.md`) — see [`doc-working-plan`](doc-working-plan.md). Checkbox-driven execution checklist with file-level granularity.
