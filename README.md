CROW is a storage platform — a foundation layer for building storage systems where you own the hot path all the way down to the metal. The first component is **crow-kv**, a distributed key-value cluster that takes Multi-Paxos seriously: not as a textbook exercise, but as a deliberate engineering choice to eliminate Raft's sequential commit bottleneck on the write hot path.

## Why This Project

A high-performance distributed KV store is the natural foundation layer: put one underneath a larger storage system and its overall architecture simplifies considerably. But that only works with full control over the KV itself — the freedom to make targeted optimizations as workloads demand. Off-the-shelf components don't offer that, so CROW builds one from scratch as its first component.

And since future performance gains are increasingly tied to hardware (io_uring, NVMe, CPU cache behavior), the platform is Rust + C++, keeping the hot paths close to the metal.

> **Project started July 10, 2026.** Built by a single developer working with AI.

### Demos

**Cluster Lifecycle** — bootstrap a 3-node cluster from scratch: add a rack, register nodes in the physical view, then switch to the logical view to create a store and a Paxos group with replicas on the selected target nodes. The topology canvas updates in real time as replicas come online and elect a leader.

**KV Operations** — the KV Operator panel auto-loads demo keys, then demonstrates put, get, and delete against a specific group. The scan list updates live after each mutation, and demo keys can be bulk-deleted in one click.

**Failover & Replica Management** — add a 4th node and expand the group from 3 to 4 replicas, then remove the leader replica. The remaining nodes re-elect a new leader and KV operations continue uninterrupted. The removed replica is added back afterward. Note: even-numbered replica counts fall back to an odd quorum and function correctly, but odd counts are recommended for production deployments.

## Why Multi-Paxos?

Raft's log is contiguous by construction: a leader cannot acknowledge slot N+1 until slot N is committed. Under high concurrency this becomes a sequential bottleneck.

Multi-Paxos treats each slot as an independent Paxos instance. Slots can be **decided and applied out of order**, turning a sequential wait into a fully pipelined commit path. crow-kv pays for this with extra complexity around gap repair and a slightly more conservative read frontier — a tradeoff documented in detail in the [design doc](doc/design/kv/design-crow-kv.md#1-overview).

```

- **Multi-group sharding** — each node hosts multiple Paxos groups; routing is by explicit `group_id`. Group membership and key ranges are operator-defined.
- **Pluggable storage** — the WAL is the source of truth; the key-value engine is a derived projection. An in-memory engine and `crow-tree` (a custom B+tree with delta-chain encoding, io_uring async I/O, and epoch-safe lock-free reads) are both implemented behind a unified `KVEngine` trait.
- **Raft where it doesn't matter, Paxos where it does** — leader election, leases, snapshot install, and reconfiguration follow settled Raft designs. Only the write hot path diverges into Multi-Paxos.
- **Console** — a web UI and CLI for cluster lifecycle management (bootstrap, rolling upgrade, replica add/remove, health monitoring).

## Crates

| Crate | What it is |
| --- | --- |
| `crow-kv` | Core library: Multi-Paxos consensus, WAL, storage engine trait, RPC, reconfiguration |
| `crow-kv-server` | Server binary: hosts groups, serves gRPC + HTTP management API |
| `crow-kv-client` | Client library: topology cache, retry, idempotency |
| `crow-tree` | Custom storage engine (C++ core): B+tree, delta chains, io_uring reactor, buffer pool |
| `crow-tree-ffi` | Rust FFI bindings to `crow-tree` — exposes the C++ engine as a `KVEngine` trait impl |
| `crow-common` | Shared C++/Rust utilities: async logging (spdlog), compressing file sink |
| `crow-console-shared` | Console core library: cluster config, lifecycle (deploy/stop), SSH, topology model |
| `crow-web` | Web console (Axum + React): cluster lifecycle UI, KV operator panel, Swagger |
| `crow-cli` | CLI console (`clap`): same management surface as the web console |

<summary><b>Getting Started</b></summary>

CROW uses [Pixi](https://pixi.sh) for environment management — it pins the C++ toolchain, Rust compiler, and all native dependencies (cmake, gtest, lz4, folly, protobuf, etc.) in a single lockfile. The Linux build targets glibc 2.17 (CentOS 7 / Ubuntu 16.04 era), so binaries built once run on virtually any modern Linux distribution.

```bash
# Install pixi (if not already installed)
curl -fsSL https://pixi.sh/install.sh | sh

# Build everything (crow-tree C++ + Rust workspace + web UI)
pixi run build

# Run all tests (C++ ctest + Rust unit/integration + web + Playwright e2e)
pixi run test-suite
```

## Performance

crow-kv's hot path is built around a few core design choices:

- **Pipelined inflight window** — Multi-Paxos decides slots out of order, so the leader admits many proposals in parallel instead of serializing one at a time like Raft.
- **Server-side proposal coalescing** — concurrent single-key client ops are batched into one slot and one quorum round, amortizing the consensus RPC cost across the whole batch.
- **Queue-based admission** — when the window is full, proposals block on a semaphore instead of being rejected as `Busy`; no client-side retry storms.
- **Off-critical-path durability & apply** — the leader's local fsync (early-ack) and engine apply (async, fenced) both run off the per-proposal critical path, leaving only the quorum RPC round-trip.
- **Zero-copy hot path** — `Bytes` ref-counting, vectored `writev` for WAL flush, FFI batch-apply slices, and `PinnedValue`-backed reads that hand a `Bytes` straight from the C++ frame with no copy.
- **Lease fast-path reads** — linearizable reads cost ~0 barrier when the leader's lease is valid; MinSlot reads spread across all replicas.

**Write Performance** — 3-node cluster, in-memory WAL + storage, write-only, 512-byte values, 1M key space, 10-second duration, `coalesce_max_keys=32`, `max_inflight=32`, admission policy = `Queue`. AMD Ryzen 9 5950X (16 cores / 32 threads, Linux). Zero errors across all configurations.

| Threads | Connections | Throughput (ops/s) | Avg Latency | p99 Latency | Busy Rejections |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | 1 | 3,029 | 327 µs | 428 µs | 0 |
| 4 | 2 | 12,681 | 313 µs | 496 µs | 0 |
| 16 | 4 | 32,935 | 483 µs | 804 µs | 0 |
| 32 | 16 | 52,688 | 604 µs | 1,180 µs | 0 |
| 64 | 32 | 75,280 | 846 µs | 1,850 µs | 0 |
| 128 | 32 | 105,779 | 1,204 µs | 2,592 µs | 0 |
| 256 | 32 | 123,745 | 2,058 µs | 4,392 µs | 0 |

Peak **123K ops/s** at 256 threads — 4.3× the non-coalesced ceiling (~29K) from batching single-key ops into one slot/round. The per-proposal critical path is the quorum RPC round-trip only; the leader's fsync and engine apply both run off it. **Zero `Busy` rejections** across all configs — queue admission backpressures instead of rejecting.

**Read Performance** — same setup, read-only, 200K key space pre-populated. All three replicas run on one machine, so MinSlot's 3-replica parallelism is bounded by the same CPU as Linearizable — they converge at peak. In a multi-node deployment, MinSlot would scale across separate machines. Zero errors across all configurations.

| Threads | Connections | Linearizable ops/s | Linearizable p99 | MinSlot ops/s | MinSlot p99 |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | 1 | 5,876 | 233 µs | 5,876 | 233 µs |
| 6 | 6 | 47,366 | 200 µs | 45,563 | 183 µs |
| 24 | 24 | 120,494 | 403 µs | 112,172 | 444 µs |
| 48 | 48 | 144,486 | 828 µs | 135,928 | 884 µs |

Peak **145K ops/s** — ~1.17× the coalesced write peak (124K). Reads skip the consensus critical path entirely (no WAL, no quorum RPC); the lease barrier costs ~0 when valid, so a linearizable read is just engine get + gRPC RTT.
