## Scan Flow

```
Client SCAN(prefix, start_after, limit, read_mode, min_slot?)
  → CrowkvClient::scan                            [client.rs]
    1. resolve_min_slot — MinSlot: auto-attach write watermark;
       Linearizable: 0
    2. resolve_read_endpoint — Linearizable: cached leader;
       MinSlot + AnyReplica: round-robin across replicas
    3. send KvScanRequest via unary RPC, S3-style pagination
       (server applies a 3.5 MiB byte budget per page; client
       transparently pages until !truncated or limit reached)
    4. retry: not_leader_hint → follow (uncounted);
       error → counted + backoff; transport error → refresh + backoff
  → KvStoreService::scan (gRPC)                    [kv_service.rs]
    5. [Linearizable] forward to leader if not already
    6. [MinSlot] serve local — no forwarding
  → PxKvStore::kv_scan                             [px_kv_store.rs]
    7. resolve_read_point → ReadDecision (same as get)
    8. learner.engine_scan(prefix, start_after, limit, byte_budget)
  → CrowTreeEngine::scan → try_scan                [crow_tree_engine.rs]
    9. try_scan → ScanOutcome::Ready (fast path, all pages resident)
       or ScanOutcome::Pending (cold-leaf miss, reactor demand-load
       retry loop, cursor resumes from last resolved key)
       [start_after pushed down: descent targets the leaf containing
        start_after, merge loop skips keys <= start_after natively,
        limit applied without over-fetching — O(limit), not O(prefix)]
  → Crowtree::scan (C++ engine)                    [crow-tree.cpp]
    10. L0: skip-list cursor (R50) — lock-free, zero-copy,
        materializes only entries that reach the output
    11. L1: LeafChainCursor (R48) — lazy k-way merge of delta chain
        + base frame, binary-search seek, O(limit) not O(entries-per-leaf)
    12. merge loop: min-key select, highest-slot-wins on collision,
        early stop past prefix; byte budget caps the page
    13. packed result → take_buf → decode_scan slices one Bytes per
        entry — zero-copy, no per-entry Vec<u8>
  → Client receives KvScanResponse
    14. prost Bytes passed through directly (no to_vec);
        pagination continues if truncated and limit not reached
```

**Copy points**: O(limit) for L0/L1 cursor materialization (only
entries that reach the output); O(n) unavoidable for gRPC + FFI
serialization. The scan path is zero-copy from packed buffer to client
`Bytes`, matching the get path after R6.

---

## Change History

- **R6** — Zero-copy value returns: L1 hits borrow directly from the
  resident leaf frame (no `std::string` staging). Scan values are
  zero-copy from packed buffer to client `Bytes`.
- **R38/R44/R49** — Zero-copy scan values + streaming scan RPC.
  Unblocked `full_100k` (previously 0 scans/s, 4 MiB unary cap) and
  `valuesize_16KiB` (previously 0 scans/s). 15-20% improvement on
  large scans.
- **R48** — Lazy `LeafChainCursor`: replaced eager whole-leaf
  resolution with an on-demand k-way cursor. Scan cost went from
  O(entries-per-leaf) to O(limit). Fixed the 1 KiB anomaly.
- **R50** — Epoch-protected lock-free MemTable: replaced
  `absl::btree_map` under `mu_` with a `ConcurrentSkipList`.
  Eliminated the O(N_l0) `snapshot()` copy; readers traverse L0
  lock-free with zero copy.

### Single-thread (1T:1C) — per-scan engine cost

| Label | Limit | Start_after | Val B | Mode | scans/s | avg us | p99 us | err |
|-------|------:|-------------|------:|------|--------:|-------:|-------:|----:|

| minslot_1k | 1000 | | 64 | minslot | 4293 | 232 | 262 | 0 |

`mixed_1k` uses `--value-size-mix 64:70,1024:20,16384:10` — 70% 64B,
20% 1KiB, 10% 16KiB values, deterministically assigned by key id. At
991 scans/s it sits between the old `valuesize_1KiB` (1492) and
`valuesize_16KiB` (74), reflecting the weighted average of the three
sizes with 0 errors (the 16KiB fraction is small enough to avoid the
replication backpressure issue seen at 100% 16KiB).

### Multi-thread — max throughput + read-mode split

| Label | Limit | Val B | Mode | T:C | scans/s | avg us | p99 us | err |
|-------|------:|------:|------|-----|--------:|-------:|-------:|----:|
| lin_4t | 1000 | 64 | lin | 4:4 | 14264 | 279 | 473 | 0 |

| lin_32t | 1000 | 64 | lin | 32:32 | 37840 | 842 | 3600 | 0 |
| minslot_32t | 1000 | 64 | minslot | 32:32 | 38256 | 830 | 2028 | 0 |

Linearizable scales well up to 16T (4339 → 30799, 7.1x) then saturates
at 32T (37840) — the leader read barrier becomes the bottleneck.
MinSlot shows a clear advantage:
- **16T:16C**: +7.2% throughput (33015 vs 30799) — distributed read
  serving across 3 replicas scales better than single-leader.
- **32T:32C**: throughput saturates for both (+1.1%), but MinSlot's
  p99 is 44% better (2028us vs 3600us) — load distribution keeps tail
  latency low even when throughput is capped by the engine.

Linux is ~3.6x slower than macOS on single-thread bounded scans
(5367 vs 19558 for `bounded_10`), consistent with the x86_64 build
running under a slower single-core memory subsystem. Multi-thread
scaling is also lower: 16T reaches 18283 scans/s (vs 30799 on macOS),
and MinSlot does **not** show the throughput advantage seen on macOS —
linearizable is actually faster at 4T and 16T. At 32T both modes
saturate at ~23k scans/s with near-identical throughput, though
MinSlot's p99 is still 26% better (2746 vs 3732 us). The MinSlot
advantage appears platform-dependent and may relate to the different
cache hierarchy and inter-core latency of x86_64 vs arm64.

### Improvement summary (pre-R48 → post-R48+R50, macOS)

| Config | Before scans/s | After scans/s | Improvement |
|--------|---------------:|--------------:|------------:|
| bounded_10 | 223 | 19558 | 87.7x |
| bounded_1k | 224 | 4339 | 19.4x |
| deep_pag_10 | 147 | 20681 | 140.7x |
| full_100k | 20 | 50 | 2.5x |

Two changes drove the 20-140x improvement on bounded scans:

- **R48 (lazy `LeafChainCursor`)**: the old `resolve_chain_sorted`
  rebuilt each touched leaf's entire live entry set into a `std::map`
  per scan — O(entries-per-leaf × log), not O(limit). 64B packs
  ~640 entries per 64KiB leaf vs ~58 for 1 KiB, so each leaf resolve
  was far more expensive for 64B (this caused the 1 KiB anomaly where
  1 KiB was 3.8x faster than 64B despite returning 16x more data). The
  lazy cursor merges delta chain + base frame on demand, binary-searches
  on seek, and emits only the entries the scan returns — cost tracks
  `limit`, not leaf fullness. Post-fix: 64B is 2.9x faster than 1 KiB
  (cost tracks bytes returned, not entries per leaf).
- **R50 (epoch-protected MemTable)**: `MemTable::snapshot()` deep-copied
  every live L0 entry on every scan — O(N_l0) regardless of limit.
  Under concurrent write+scan this dominated scan time (82-94% per the
  Gate 2 microbench). Replaced with a `ConcurrentSkipList` (inline keys,
  versioned cell pointers, epoch-deferred reclamation) — readers
  traverse L0 lock-free under their existing epoch guard with zero copy;
  the cursor seeks directly and materializes only O(limit) entries.

Deep pagination is flat (equal to from-start) — O(limit) confirmed.

## Open Problems

Full-path audit (client → gRPC → PxKvStore → FFI → C++ engine),
2026-08-07. Each item is tracked by a backlog requirement except where
noted.

- **[R52](../../backlog/R52-reverse-scan.md) — Reverse scan**: `scan`
  is forward-only today (ascending key order). Reverse scan needs
  backward cursor traversal in both L0 (skip-list, forward-only) and
  L1 (`LeafChainCursor`), a `direction` field on `KvScanRequest`, and
  S3-style pagination keyed on the first key of each page as the next
  `start_before`.
- **R53 — 16 KiB scan errors (replication backpressure)** —
  **Done.** `valuesize_16KiB` showed intermittent errors (452 in one
  run, 0 in others). Root cause was NOT the scan path — the
  `learner_stream` outbound queue filled up during pre-populate with 16
  KiB values, blocking heartbeats to followers. E5 (heartbeat reserved
  capacity) guaranteed heartbeat admission to the queue but not wire
  priority — a heartbeat behind N 16 KiB accepts was delayed by their
  cumulative flush time. Fix: steady-state heartbeats now route over a
  dedicated gRPC `Channel` (separate TCP connection) via the existing
  unary `heartbeat` RPC; accepts and `ChosenNotification` stay on the
  `LearnerStream`. The E5 reserve mechanism was removed (dead code once
  heartbeats left the `LearnerStream`). See
  `design-crow-kv-rpc.md` §3.
- **[R54](../../backlog/R54-kv-scan-engine-profiling.md) —
  High-concurrency engine bottleneck (MEASURED)**: MinSlot shows a
  +7.2% throughput advantage at 16T:16C (33015 vs 30799 scans/s) and
  44% better p99 at 32T:32C (2028us vs 3600us). The throughput
  advantage peaks around 16T then both modes saturate near ~38k
  scans/s at 32T — the crow-tree engine (C++ merge loop over L0
  skip-list + L1 B+tree cursor) becomes the bottleneck, not the read
  barrier. No code change needed for the read-mode split itself;
  profiling the engine bottleneck is the open work.
- **[R55](../../backlog/R55-kv-scan-carry-read-slot.md) — Per-page
  linearizable read barrier**: `PxKvStore::kv_scan` calls
  `resolve_read_point` on every page (`px_kv_store.rs:183`), so a
  multi-page linearizable scan pays the barrier (lease check, or a
  quorum heartbeat round on the ReadIndex fallback) once per page. The
  client already receives `read_slot` from page 1 — carry it forward
  as `min_slot` and serve subsequent pages via the MinSlot path.
  Semantics are unchanged (cross-page results are already not a single
  snapshot; each page would still be at least as fresh as page 1) and
  later pages skip the barrier entirely. Client-local, no proto change.
- **[R56](../../backlog/R56-kv-scan-end-key-bound.md) — Prefix-only
  range predicate**: `KvScanRequest` has `prefix` + `start_after` but
  no exclusive `end_key`, so an arbitrary `[start, end)` range cannot
  be expressed. The engine's early-stop already compares against
  `prefix`; adding an optional `end_key` bound to the merge loop, FFI,
  proto, and client is a small, low-risk extension (and is a
  prerequisite shape for R52 reverse scan).
- **[R57](../../backlog/R57-tree-scan-zero-copy-staging.md) —
  Engine-side result staging is 3 copies, not zero-copy**: the
  "zero-copy" claim above holds only from the FFI packed buffer to the
  client. Inside the engine, each page's result set is copied three
  times before crossing the FFI boundary:
  1. `Crowtree::scan`'s `consider` lambda stages every entry via
     `key.to_string()` + `value.to_string()` into
     `std::vector<scan_entry>` (`crow-tree.cpp` ~1853/1868);
  2. `ct_scan` re-packs those strings into a `std::string packed`
     (`c_api.cpp` ~913-921);
  3. `make_buf` mallocs and memcpys `packed` again (`c_api.cpp:43`).
  For a full 3.5 MiB page that is ~10.5 MiB of memcpy + 2 transient
  allocations. Fix: pack the wire format directly in the `consider`
  lambda (single growing buffer) and transfer ownership across the FFI
  instead of `make_buf` (an ownership-transfer path already exists —
  see `make_borrowed_buf` and the get fast path). Likely the cheapest
  large win.
- **[R58](../../backlog/R58-tree-scan-merge-loop-fast-path.md) —
  Merge loop is O(N_sources) comparisons per entry**: min-key
  selection re-compares every L0 cursor plus L1 for each output entry
  (`crow-tree.cpp` ~1893-1934), each a byte-wise `Slice::compare`.
  With several frozen memtables live this multiplies. A loser-tree /
  two-element fast path (common case: 1 active L0 + L1) would cut
  compares; no prefetch (`__builtin_prefetch`) is issued for the next
  skip-list node or the right-sibling leaf.
- **[R59](../../backlog/R59-kv-snapshot-scan.md) — Two scan modes +
  snapshot versioning API**: the current `scan` is the only range-read
  surface (S3-list semantics: per-page consistent, not cross-page). R59
  formalizes two modes: (1) **list scan** — the existing `scan`, fast,
  latest values, for interactive listing; (2) **snapshot versioning
  API** — flush + `snapshot_view()` (already built, pins L1 at
  `last_applied_slot`, zero-copy page refcounts) + iterate the frozen
  vector with prefix/pagination. New RPCs: `CreateSnapshot`/
  `ListSnapshots`/`SnapshotScan`/`ReleaseSnapshot` + management API for
  `SetGcWatermark`. No new engine machinery (no version chain, no L0
  pinning — flush drains L0 first). Active snapshots protect pinned
  pages from GC via refcount. Medium complexity.
- **[R60](../../backlog/R60-tree-scan-sibling-leaf-readahead.md) —
  No sibling-leaf readahead on cold scans**: the sync path
  demand-loads each leaf inline; the async path resolves one pending
  page per reactor round trip (`scan_async_attempt`). A scan knows its
  next leaf (`right_sibling`) before finishing the current one —
  issuing the next read ahead of the merge loop would overlap I/O with
  merging on cold ranges.
- **[R61](../../backlog/R61-kv-scan-keys-only-projection.md) —
  No keys-only / count-only projection**: scans always materialize
  and ship values. A `keys_only` flag would skip value staging in the
  engine (including overflow-chain assembly — the most expensive
  materialization) and shrink pages by the value fraction; a
  count-style scan falls out of the same pushdown. Useful for key
  listing, prefix cardinality, and the console UI.
- **[R62](../../backlog/R62-kv-scan-deadline-cancellation.md) —
  No scan deadline / cancellation**: no per-scan timeout at any layer;
  an unbounded `limit=0` scan over a large keyspace runs until the
  transport gives up, and the engine loop has no cancellation check
  between pages. A request deadline (proto field + engine-side budget
  check per page) bounds worst-case server work.
- **Streaming scan RPC (deliberately dropped — not needed)**: a
  server-streaming `ScanStream` (R38/R44 era) was replaced by the
  server byte budget + S3-style unary pagination. Streaming adds
  complexity (mid-stream error/cancellation/backpressure, HTTP/2
  flow-control stalls) and loses the clean per-page retry that
  `start_after` keying gives. The same production/transfer overlap is
  available without a proto change via client-side page prefetch
  (request page N+1 while consuming page N). No backlog entry.
