# CROW - Design: Write-Ahead Log

Depends on: [`design-crow-kv.md`](design-crow-kv.md) §8.1, §8.2
Satisfies: [`design-crow-kv.md`](design-crow-kv.md) §8.1, §8.2

This document specifies CROW's write-ahead log. **There is exactly one durable
log per group: the replica's consensus log (the per-slot acceptor log).**
Everything else — the KV state machine (`KVEngine`), future snapshots, the dedup
cache, the chosen/applied watermarks — is a *derived projection* of that log.
The `Accepted` record carries the actual operation, so this single log doubles
as the replicated command log (Raft-style) and the state-machine input; there is
no separate "state-machine WAL" and no second write of the value.

Durability rule of thumb: **if an acknowledged write is in the WAL on a quorum,
it cannot be lost** — a value is *chosen* exactly when a quorum has durably
`Accepted` it, and replay + recovery reconstruct the committed state from those
durable accepts.

## 1. Goals and Non-Goals

**Goals:**

- Bound write latency by the slower of (one durable flush) and (one quorum RTT).
- Saturate aggregate disk bandwidth by parallelizing across multiple physical disks.
- Survive arbitrary process crash with bounded recovery time.
- Survive single-disk loss without data loss (peer recovery via snapshot install).
- Be replayable into a deterministic state.

**Non-goals:**

- Cross-group log ordering. Each group has its own WAL; there is no cluster-wide log.
- Compression / deduplication at the WAL layer. (Possible future work.)
- Multi-version time-travel reads. The WAL is not queried by the read path.
- Erasure coding of records. Replication is at the consensus layer, not the disk layer.

---

## 2. Logical Record Shape

A WAL record persists one of the messages an acceptor must remember durably. Conceptually:

| Field | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `magic`, `version` | Format identifier, for upgrade compatibility |
| `record_type` | One of `{ Promised, Accepted, VoteGranted }` |
| `group_id` | Which group this record belongs to |
| `term` | Acceptor's `current_term` at the time of record (for fence verification on replay) |
| `slot` | Slot number this record concerns (n/a for `VoteGranted`) |
| `ballot` | `(round, leader_id)` for `Promised` / `Accepted` |
| `payload` | Type-specific body — for `Accepted`, the `PxLogEntry` (kind + batch); for `Promised`, empty; for `VoteGranted`, the voted-for node id |
| `payload_len` | Length, for forward-skipping malformed records |
| `crc32c` | CRC of header + payload |

Records are self-describing and length-prefixed so a corruption in one record does not destroy the rest of the segment unless followed by a CRC failure (see §6).

**Design note:** the `Accepted` record's payload IS the `PxLogEntry` — there is no separate "raft log" or "state machine log" structure. This keeps disk I/O minimal: one durable flush per accepted batch, no further logging.

`Promised` records exist for safety: classical Paxos requires acceptors to remember promises across crashes. They are short (no payload).

### 2.4 When each record is written

The WAL is written **only on the acceptor/election critical path**, before the
handler replies (the ack contract, §5). The mapping is exhaustive:

| Handler (`PxLocalReplica`) | Trigger | Record | Payload |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `on_prepare` | acceptor grants a promise | `Promised` | none (slot + ballot + term in header) |
| `on_accept` | acceptor accepts a value | `Accepted` | the `PxLogEntry` (kind + KV batch + `client_id`/`seq`) |
| `handle_request_vote` | acceptor grants a vote | `VoteGranted` | `voted_for` node id (term in header) |

**`learn()` writes nothing.** Applying a chosen value to the `KVEngine` is a pure
in-memory projection; its durability comes entirely from the `Accepted` records
that a quorum already persisted. The state machine's KV state is **not** rebuilt
from the WAL on restart — instead, the state machine will persist its own
snapshot (with a slot index) to disk. On restart, the state machine loads its
snapshot and the WAL replay only rebuilds acceptor state (promises + accepted
values). The learner / `KVEngine` is repopulated by new-leader recovery (§6.4)
or steady-state heartbeat catch-up (§6.5).

This design avoids a separate `DurableCommitWatermark` WAL record type. The
WAL carries only consensus state (`Promised`, `Accepted`, `VoteGranted`); the
state machine owns its own persistence boundary via snapshots.

## 3. Multi-Disk Segment Layout

### 3.1 Why multiple disks

A single disk's fsync latency caps single-group write throughput at `1 / fsync_latency` IOPS, which on commodity NVMe is ~10–30k. Multiple disks give us linear scaling up to the network/CPU limit.

### 3.2 Layout

Each acceptor configures `wal_disks = [path_1, path_2, ...]`. Each disk holds a sequence of **segments**. A segment is a single append-only byte stream containing records in append order for that disk. It is **not** required to contain a contiguous slot interval.

With multiple disks, global slot order and physical record order intentionally diverge:

```
   /wal_disk_1/groupN/seg-0000001.ck   slots {1,4,7,...}
   /wal_disk_1/groupN/seg-0000004.ck   slots {361,364,367,...}
   /wal_disk_2/groupN/seg-0000002.ck   slots {2,5,8,...}
   /wal_disk_2/groupN/seg-0000005.ck   slots {362,365,368,...}
   /wal_disk_3/groupN/seg-0000003.ck   slots {3,6,9,...}
```

- Each segment is named with a monotonic `segment_id` within the group.
- Segments are pre-allocated to a target size (`wal_segment_size`, default 64 MiB) and sealed when full.
- Each sealed segment records `(min_slot, max_slot, record_count)` as scan metadata; `min_slot..max_slot` may contain holes because slot ownership is distributed across disks and because non-slot records exist.
- Replay correctness comes from sorting / indexing records by `(group_id, slot, ballot, record_type)` after reading them, not from physical segment order.

**Slot-to-segment mapping** is recorded in an in-memory **segment index** that points each slot to one or more `(disk, segment_id, file_offset)` records. A persisted index may be used as a startup accelerator, but it is only a cache: replay must be able to rebuild the authoritative index by scanning segment records.

### 3.3 Slot-to-disk assignment

When the acceptor receives a slot-addressed record (`Promised` or `Accepted`) for slot N, it chooses the target disk by deterministic slot affinity:

```
   disk = hash(group_id, slot) % wal_disks.len()
```

This is the default and correctness-oriented mapping. All records for the same `(group_id, slot)` land on the same disk, so replay can recover that slot without merging same-slot histories from multiple disks. The mapping is stable across restart as long as `wal_disks` order is stable.

Each disk owns an independent append queue, active segment, flush worker, and durable-flush state. Concurrent slot writes still parallelize because adjacent slots hash across disks, but same-slot retries and higher-ballot re-accepts preserve disk locality.

Non-slot records use fixed lanes:

- `VoteGranted` and other election metadata go to the group metadata lane (`disk = hash(group_id, 0) % wal_disks.len()`).
- Group membership configuration is persisted in a dedicated config file (`group_config.bin`) in the group's WAL directory, not as a WAL record.

A future load-aware mode is only legal if it preserves slot affinity, for example by moving whole slot shards through an explicit re-sharding protocol. Per-record load-aware placement is not allowed for slot-addressed records.

Because apply order is determined by the slot index in memory, the *physical* order of records on disk does not affect correctness (Invariant I4). This is what allows multiple disks to flush in parallel.

### 3.4 Segment rotation

A segment is rotated (sealed and a new one opened) when it reaches
`wal_segment_size`. (Future: slot-range boundary rotation for GC granularity,
admin force-rotate, and leader-change rotation are design options not yet
implemented.)

Sealed segments are immutable.

## 4. Write Path and Batched Durable Flush

### 4.1 Goal of batching

Each individual `Accept` is small (tens of bytes overhead + payload). Per-record durable flush is wasteful: an SSD's flush amortizes over a batch nearly as well as over a single record. CROW therefore batches records per WAL disk and completes the record futures only after the selected backend has made the bytes durable.

The durable operation is backend-specific:

- **Filesystem file backend:** append with normal file writes, then `fdatasync` / equivalent durable flush.
- **Block-device backend:** issue aligned direct writes. If the device requires 4 KiB sectors, the WAL writer pads or read-modify-writes through the block backend's alignment planner; no filesystem `fdatasync` is involved.
- **RAM / SCM / simulated backends:** use the backend's own durability contract. A volatile RAM backend is for tests only and may complete immediately; persistent-memory backends may require cache-line flush / fence semantics instead of filesystem sync.

The acceptor code talks to `WalEngine::append_*` and does not branch on these backend details.

### 4.2 Batch coalescing

For each disk, the WAL maintains a **pending queue**:

```
   pending_queue[disk] = [ record_1, record_2, ..., record_k ]
```

Records arrive concurrently from many `Accept` handlers. They are appended to the in-memory segment buffer for that disk and pushed onto the disk's pending queue. A single **flush worker** per disk owns the active segment, drains queued records into one backend write batch, calls the backend-specific durable flush, and then **completes all pending records' futures together**.

The worker is event-driven, not timer-first:

1. If the queue is empty, the worker awaits a notification from the next enqueue.
2. When notified, it drains all records currently available without waiting for a fixed 1 ms interval.
3. If more records arrive while the write is being assembled, they are included until the batch reaches `wal_flush_batch_bytes` or the drain loop observes no immediately-ready records.
4. The worker issues one backend write / durable-flush operation for the drained batch.
5. On success, it resolves every drained record future; on error, it fails them and marks the affected disk / group unhealthy.

This gives low latency for a single record while still aggregating bursts naturally.

### 4.3 Triggers for durable flush

The flush worker flushes when any of:

- It is woken by a transition from empty queue to non-empty queue (`rx.recv().await`).
- Pending bytes ≥ `wal_flush_batch_bytes` (default 64 KiB) — breaks the drain loop early.
- The watchdog (`wal_flush_watchdog_ms`, default 100 ms) is a safety-net timer that wakes the idle writer every `watchdog` ms to drain any queued records in case of a missed wake (a defensive measure "just in case for bugs"). The idle wakeup does a `try_recv` drain and re-parks if nothing is queued — no I/O, no allocation, ~10 wakeups/s at the default 100 ms.

Default behavior is **wake-drain-flush**: a lone record flushes immediately, while a concurrent burst gets batched because the worker drains all immediately-ready records before issuing I/O. A coalescing budget (`wal_flush_coalesce_us`) was previously available but was removed after T3 benchmarking showed no gain over the wake-drain-flush baseline.

### 4.4 Async write completion

Each `Accept` handler returns a future. The flush worker resolves the future with `Ok` after the backend durable flush completes; on disk error it resolves with `Err` (which the acceptor escalates per §8). The acceptor only emits the network `Accepted` response after the future resolves — this is the **ack contract** ([§5](#5-ack-contract-and-failure-modes)).

The future-based interface decouples the acceptor's handler from disk timing and allows multiple in-flight `Accept`s to coalesce into one durable flush naturally.

### 4.5 Why this maps onto Multi-Paxos parallelism

Different slots may be in flight on different disks at the same time. Slot N may be batching on disk 1 while slot N+1 batches on disk 2. Both durable flushes proceed in parallel. Aggregate flush throughput is `sum over disks of (1 / flush_latency)` — exactly the parallel benefit we want.

Crucially, the leader's **own** durable flush is not on the critical path of remote acceptors' durable flushes. The leader persists locally, then broadcasts; remote acceptors flush in parallel. Two durable flushes total in serial: leader's, and the slowest of the quorum. With multiple disks each durable flush can itself be parallelized internally, but the consensus-level parallelism is what dominates throughput.

### 4.6 I/O backend abstraction

The WAL dispatches all file operations through `IoBackend`, a process-lifetime
enum with three variants:

- **`File`** — `tokio::fs` + `spawn_blocking` for `fdatasync`. The production
  default; works everywhere. `fdatasync` is a no-op (only `fsync` on close
  calls `sync_all`).
- **`MemBlock(MemBlockDevice)`** — in-memory test harness. Stores segments as
  `BTreeMap<PathBuf, Vec<u8>>` with error injection (`inject_io_error`,
  `inject_sync_error`, `set_full`), corruption injection
  (`corrupt_at_offset`), and layout tracking. `fdatasync` is a no-op (data is
  already "durable" in RAM). Used by all unit/integration tests.
- **`BlockDevice(BlockDevice)`** — real file-backed block device. Always opens
  OS paths and does positional I/O (`pwrite`/`pread`) via `FileExt`.
  `fdatasync` calls `sync_data`. Whether the path is a regular file, a raw
  block device, or a tmpfs file makes no difference — in Unix, a block device
  *is* a file.

`BlockDevice` has two constructors selected by the `O_DIRECT` flag:

- `BlockDevice::new()` — aligned (4K), buffered (no `O_DIRECT`). Default for
  benchmarks and general use. All alignment/RMW logic runs, `fdatasync`
  performs a real `sync_data`, but the page cache absorbs writes.
- `BlockDevice::ssd()` — aligned (4K), `O_DIRECT` (Linux only). Models a real
  SSD/NVMe with direct I/O bypassing the page cache.

`MemBlockDevice` has two constructors selected by alignment:

- `MemBlockDevice::new()` — unaligned (IU=1, byte-addressable). Models RAM /
  SCM / PMEM. Default for tests.
- `MemBlockDevice::with_alignment(align)` — aligned in-memory. For testing
  RMW logic without real files.

Both `BlockDevice` and `MemBlockDevice` track write counts, fdatasync counts,
logical/physical bytes written, and RMW counts for observability. The
`WalEngine::backend_label()` method returns a short string (`"file"`,
`"mem"`, `"block"`) for metric names. `WalEngine::block_device_snapshot()`
reads cumulative counters for the engine collector to compute per-window
deltas.

The WAL bench (`lib/crow-kv/benches/wal.rs`) exercises three backends: `Mem`
(in-memory `MemBlockDevice`), `File` (`tokio::fs`), and `Block`
(`BlockDevice::new()` with `wal_skip_fsync: true`). The `Block` case hits all
block code paths (alignment planning, RMW, amplification tracking,
`pwrite`/`pread` syscalls) at high TPS since `fdatasync` is skipped per
batch.

The crow-tree C++ storage layer has a similar but cleaner separation:
`TextPageStore` (debug text files), `MemPageStore` (in-memory), and
`BlockPageStore` (real block device with `O_DIRECT`). Each is a distinct C++
class — no flag-based branching. The Rust FFI `PageStoreBackend` enum (`File`,
`Block`, `MemBlock`) maps to these. No structural change was needed on the
crow-tree side for this refactor.

## 5. Ack Contract and Failure Modes

### 5.1 The contract

> An `Accepted` response is sent to the leader only after the corresponding WAL record's backend durable flush has completed.
> A client write is acked only after a quorum of acceptors have sent `Accepted`.

This is repeated from design-crow-kv.md §8.1](design-crow-kv.md) because everything else in this section is a consequence of it. This is the **strict** mode. The **early-ack** mode (§5.4) relaxes the leader's own durability ordering but keeps the quorum-durability requirement; both modes are described in §5.4.

### 5.2 Failure cases

- **Crash before durable flush.** The record may or may not be on disk. Replay reads what is on disk; the slot may end up with no record on this acceptor. That is fine — the leader either had a quorum from other acceptors (slot is chosen) or not (slot will be repaired). In strict mode no client was acked for this acceptor's slot, so no expectation is violated; in early-ack mode (§5.4) the leader may have acked the client on the remote quorum alone, and the chosen-but-not-locally-durable slot is re-adopted by `repair_once` from the followers on restart.

  On restart, the new leader computes its recovery ceiling from durable state, not from an assumed contiguous log tail: `ceiling = max(local highest_seen_slot, peers' highest_seen_slot, persisted next_slot - 1 if present)`. Because parallel writes may leave holes inside `[floor+1, ceiling]`, the leader must run bulk Phase 1 over the whole open interval and fill empty slots with `NoOp`. It does **not** rely on `latest_slot + window_size` to discover hidden data; any value absent from every acceptor's durable state could not have formed a durable quorum and therefore could not have been acknowledged.

- **Crash after durable flush, before sending `Accepted`.** Replay finds the record. After the acceptor rejoins the group, the leader observes the existing accept (via heartbeat / slot-status query) and includes this acceptor in the quorum.
- **Crash after sending `Accepted`, before the leader acked the client.** Same as above — the record is on disk; if a quorum was reached, the slot is chosen; the new leader's bulk Phase-1 will see this and re-confirm.
- **Durable-flush failure (returns `Err`).** Treated as a disk fault. The acceptor stops accepting new records on that disk and marks itself failed for the affected group; see §8.

### 5.3 What we never do

- Ack a client write before a quorum of acceptors have durably flushed. This holds in both ack modes (§5.4): the early-ack mode defers only the *leader's own* durable flush, never the remote quorum's.
- Declare a slot `Chosen` without a quorum of `Accepted` responses (remote durable + leader CAS in early-ack mode; remote durable + leader durable in strict mode).

### 5.4 Ack modes (`wal_early_ack`)

The ack contract in §5.1 is the **strict** mode: every acceptor — including the leader — completes its WAL durable flush before its `Accepted` counts toward `Chosen`, and the client is acked only after the leader's own flush joins the quorum. `wal_early_ack` (default `true`, gated on `quorum > 1`) is a **relaxed** mode that drops the leader's local fsync off the write critical path:

- The leader runs `on_accept_inner` (the term-fence CAS + in-memory `acceptor.accept`) concurrently with the remote `send_accept` fan-out via `tokio::join!`.
- `Chosen` is declared as soon as the **remote quorum** has durably flushed *and* the leader's local CAS has landed. The leader's own WAL `Accepted` record is appended by a fire-and-forget `tokio::spawn` (`spawn_accept_persist`) that runs off the critical path; its failure is logged and does not retract `Chosen`.
- The client is acked at that point. The per-proposal critical path becomes the quorum RPC round-trip only (the local fsync, ~10–100 µs on NVMe, runs concurrently and is no longer on the path).

**Crash-recovery guarantee.** A crash in the window between the leader's CAS landing and the deferred local persist is Paxos-safe: the value is chosen (remote quorum accepted durably), so the client's observed `Chosen` is not violated. The leader's acceptor state for that slot is lost on crash (the CAS was in memory, the WAL record never landed), but on restart `replay_group` rebuilds from durable state only and `repair_once` re-adopts the chosen value for the gap slot from the followers (classic prepare + accept re-runs and re-chooses the highest-ballot accepted value). A value the client observed as `Chosen` therefore remains readable after crash + restart — either the local WAL raced the kill and has it, or repair re-adopts it from the quorum.

**Single-node gate.** `wal_early_ack` defaults to `true` only when `quorum > 1`. A single-node group (quorum = 1) has no survivors to re-drive a chosen-but-not-locally-durable slot after a crash, so the leader's local fsync must stay on the critical path and the strict contract (§5.1) applies.

**What is not relaxed.** The remote quorum's durable flush is still on the critical path in both modes — `Chosen` is never declared on in-memory-only remote accepts. The relaxation is strictly the leader's *own* durability ordering, recovered by `repair_once` rather than awaited inline.

## 6. Replay, Restore, and Recovery

Turning the on-disk WAL back into a live, serving replica has three stages, then
a steady state:

- **6.1 Replay** — rebuild in-memory *acceptor* state from the records.
- **6.2 Restore** — rebuild a live replica shell from acceptor state (Pass 1), then rebuild the learner / `KVEngine` from that same acceptor state (Pass 2), skipping only the prefix the engine already durably reflects.
- **6.3 Wiring** — attach a fresh WAL engine and seed the proposer conservatively.
- **6.4 Recovery** — a new leader re-confirms *chosen* values from a quorum and fills holes.
- **6.5 Steady-state apply** — followers keep their state machine current from the leader's commit watermark.

The split matters: replay/restore are purely *local* (this node's WAL), but `Accepted` ≠ `chosen` (a value is chosen only on a quorum). Restore therefore re-derives the acceptor's local view exactly as it was (Pass 1), then re-derives the learner's committed KV state from that *same locally-accepted* data (Pass 2) — which is safe precisely because `Accepted` records already carry a chosen-or-not-yet-known value idempotently (re-`learn()`ing a value that was never actually chosen by a quorum is harmless: it just sits in the engine until either superseded by a higher slot for the same key, or never observed as chosen by anyone else, in which case it was never visible to a client anyway). Slots this node never locally accepted are, separately, left to:

- New-leader recovery / steady-state heartbeat catch-up re-learning the value from quorum-confirmed consensus (§6.4 / §6.5).

**No `DurableCommitWatermark` WAL record.** The state machine owns its own persistence boundary — but that boundary is the *engine's* durability (crow-tree's on-disk snapshot), not a separate state-machine-level snapshot file; see §6.2 below and `design-crow-kv-state-machine.md §2.1`. The WAL does not duplicate this information.

### 6.1 Replay — rebuild acceptor state (`replay_group`)

1. Discover all segments under `<wal_disk>/group<gid>/seg-*.ck`, order by `segment_id`.
2. Walk each segment's records in order; verify `magic`, `version`, `crc32c`.
   On the first failure, **truncate that segment at the offset and stop** (a torn
   tail from a crash mid-write); later segments are still processed.
3. Rebuild per-`(group, slot)` acceptor state keeping the **highest-ballot**
   `Promised` / `Accepted` per slot (later/higher-ballot records win — Paxos rule).
4. `current_term` = max `term` across all records.
5. `voted_for` = the node from the latest `VoteGranted` whose `term == current_term`. This is election safety state, not just debug metadata: after crash, the node must not grant a second vote in the same term.
6. Dedup cache = the `(client_id, seq)` of every `Accepted` record (in-memory only, rebuilt from WAL on restart).

**Dedup meaning:** client writes carry `(client_id, seq)` so a retried request can be recognized after timeout or leader change. The dedup cache stores the highest sequence and result slot already accepted for each client. It is an exactly-once / idempotency aid for client-visible behavior; it is not part of Paxos safety, but losing it can cause duplicate client operations after retry.

Output: `ReplayResult { records, max_segment_id, current_term, voted_for }`.

### 6.2 Restore — rebuild live acceptor state (`restore_from_replay`)

Pass 1 rebuilds acceptor state without assuming any local accept was ever chosen by a quorum:

- Feed `Promised` through the acceptor restore path so the highest promise per slot is preserved.
- Feed `Accepted` through the acceptor restore path so the highest accepted value per slot is available to future Phase 1.
- Seed `current_term`, `voted_for`, role from `ReplayResult`.

The learner / `KVEngine` is rebuilt in a second pass over the *same* replayed
WAL records (`PxLocalReplica::restore_from_replay_with_engine`), not from a
separate state-machine snapshot file — see
[`design-crow-kv-state-machine.md §2.1`](design-crow-kv-state-machine.md#21-state-machine-restart-engine-durability--wal-replay)
for the full mechanics. In short:

- Pass 2 walks every slot with an accepted entry (rebuilt in Pass 1 above)
  and `learn()`s it into the engine, in order. This alone is always
  sufficient and correct — `KVEngine::apply` is idempotent
  (highest-slot-wins per key) — so it works unconditionally, including for
  `InMemKV` which has no durable floor at all.
- **Optimization for a durable engine:** before Pass 2, the engine reports
  its own durable floor via `KVEngine::resume_from_slot()` (crow-tree's
  `last_applied_slot`, restored from its on-disk snapshot). Pass 2 then
  starts just above that floor instead of at slot 1, and the learner's
  frontier is fast-forwarded directly to it — skipping the redundant
  re-`learn()` of an already-durable prefix.
- Slots above the local WAL's own highest accepted slot are left to §6.4 /
  §6.5 (heartbeat catch-up / new-leader bulk Phase 1) to re-learn from peers.

This avoids resurrecting a value that was accepted locally but never chosen,
and — via the resume-floor check — never re-applies a write below a point
the engine has already durably advanced past (crow-tree rejects such writes
outright; see `../tree/design-crow-tree-engine.md`).

### 6.3 Wiring a live group (`create_group_with_wal`)

`replay_group` → create `WalEngine` and resume `next_segment_id = max_segment_id + 1` → `restore_from_replay` → `set_wal` → wrap in `PxGroup`.

The group also records a conservative local slot tip:

```
   local_tip = max(highest_seen_slot, snapshot_slot)
```

Where `snapshot_slot` is the state machine's persisted snapshot slot (0 if no snapshot exists yet).

A restarted node must not serve as leader until election and §6.4 recovery establish the quorum-derived ceiling. After recovery is issued, the leader seeds new client proposals at `next_slot = ceiling + 1`.

### 6.4 New-leader recovery (bulk Phase 1)

On winning election a leader sweeps slots `(floor, ceiling]`:

- `floor = local contiguous_chosen`; `ceiling = max(local highest_seen,
  next_slot − 1, peers' highest_seen)` (peers' values arrive in the vote replies).
- For each slot it runs Phase-1 `Prepare` across a quorum and **adopts the
  highest-ballot accepted value** observed (an empty slot becomes a `NoOp`), then
  re-`Accept`s under its term and `learn()`s it.
- Quorum intersection guarantees any chosen value is seen, so a committed value
  is **re-confirmed, not overwritten**. This repairs a leader that restored an
  incomplete or merely-accepted prefix.

(Steady-state gap repair below the frontier uses the same adopt-from-quorum logic, one slot at a time — see [`design-crow-kv-slot.md`](design-crow-kv-slot.md).)

Parallel slot assignment means holes are normal after crash / restart. Recovery resolves every slot in `(floor, ceiling]` independently:

- If Phase 1 observes an accepted value from any quorum member, the leader adopts the highest-ballot value and re-accepts it.
- If Phase 1 observes no accepted value for that slot, the leader writes a `NoOp` for the slot.
- `NoOp` has no KV payload, but it is a real chosen slot and advances contiguous watermarks; future replay sees it and does not need to repair the hole again once it is covered by the state machine snapshot.

Slot indexes are generated only by the active leader's proposer:

1. A leader tenure is fenced by election `term`; stale leaders are rejected by term / ballot checks.
2. During recovery, the leader computes `ceiling` from local and quorum-reported highest seen slots.
3. It resolves all holes up to `ceiling` with adopted values or `NoOp`.
4. It initializes `next_slot = ceiling + 1`.
5. Each admitted client proposal atomically fetches and increments `next_slot` exactly once.

This gives unique slot numbers within a leader tenure and a continuous chosen prefix after recovery, even though physical WAL placement is non-contiguous and multiple slots are processed in parallel.

### 6.5 Steady-state apply

- **Leader:** applies on commit (`propose` → quorum `Accept` → `learn`).
- **Follower:** does **not** apply on `Accept` (which only persists) nor on the
  payload-less `ChosenNotice` (which carries no value). Instead each heartbeat
  carries the leader's `committed_safe_slot`, and the follower applies its
  *contiguous accepted prefix* up to it (`apply_committed_up_to`). A follower
  missing a committed `Accept` is re-sent it by the leader's heartbeat catch-up,
  so its prefix converges over successive heartbeats.
- **Reads:** linearizable reads run on the leader behind a lease / ReadIndex
  barrier (non-leaders redirect); bounded-stale / best-effort reads serve local
  applied state.

### 6.6 Truncation safety

A truncated record is one whose CRC fails or whose payload is shorter than
`payload_len` (crash mid-write). Truncate-on-failure is safe because appends are
append-only and the bad record is the last durable one on that disk; the missing
slot was either chosen on a quorum without this node (recovered by §6.4) or never
chosen (no client was acked). A CRC failure inside a **sealed** segment is fatal:
the node fails out of the group and rebuilds from peers via snapshot install.

### 6.7 Replay performance

Replay is sequential disk reads, parallelized across disks; WAL sizes stay small
because of GC (§7), so replays are typically sub-second. The dominant cost is
state machine snapshot load (if any), not WAL read.

---

## 7. Garbage Collection

WAL GC is the mechanism that keeps disk usage bounded. It interacts with snapshots and the safe-slot.

### 7.1 GC watermark

The watermark for a group's WAL GC is:

```
   gc_slot = min(safe_slot, snapshot_slot)
```

Records with `slot < gc_slot` are eligible for GC. The two-watermark rule is justified in [`design-crow-kv-slot.md`](design-crow-kv-slot.md) §11.

### 7.2 GC granularity

GC runs at **segment granularity**, not record granularity. A whole segment is unlinked from disk when *every* record in it has `slot < gc_slot`. This is cheap (one `unlink()` per segment) and avoids any in-place rewriting.

### 7.3 GC trigger

GC is triggered by:

- Periodic tick (default 30 s) — the GC worker checks each disk and unlinks eligible segments.
- Disk-pressure signal (not yet implemented) — if any WAL disk's usage exceeds `wal_disk_high_watermark` (default 80%), GC would run immediately and may also force a snapshot to advance `snapshot_slot`.

### 7.4 Interaction with leader change

After leader change, the new leader may temporarily not know other acceptors' `contiguous_applied`, so `safe_slot` is conservatively low. GC pauses until safe-slot has stabilized. This is fine: GC is asynchronous to correctness.

### 7.5 Force-retain window

A configurable `wal_min_retention` (default 1 hour, optional) would keep even GC-eligible segments around for a grace period to support post-incident debugging. **Not yet implemented** — the GC worker currently skips the retention check (V1 simplification).

## 8. Disk Loss and Recovery

### 8.1 Single-disk failure

When the backend durable-flush operation returns an error, the OS reports the disk read-only, or repeated I/O errors exceed a threshold, the acceptor declares the disk failed:

1. Stop using the disk for new writes (the `failed` AtomicBool is set; all subsequent `append` calls return `Err`).
2. Mark the group affected (a multi-disk WAL with one disk lost has incomplete state for slots that landed on the lost disk).
3. **Fail the node out of the group** (not yet implemented): the node would send a step-out RPC to the leader, the leader records the failed acceptor as not-eligible, and (if necessary) triggers a reconfiguration to maintain quorum.
4. Rebuild from peers via **snapshot install** ([§8.4 of design-crow-kv.md](design-crow-kv.md#84-snapshot-and-install)).

This is the **fail-out semantics** decided in design-crow-kv.md §8.1](design-crow-kv.md). We do not try to keep operating with partial WAL state on the surviving disks; that path requires per-slot replication across disks and adds disproportionate complexity.

### 8.2 All-disk failure

The node is non-functional; it cannot serve any group. It must be replaced by an operator. After replacement (with empty disks) the new node bootstraps via Group-0 and snapshot installs all groups it should host.

### 8.3 Detecting silent corruption

CRC32C catches all common bit-flips and torn writes. Logical corruption (e.g. a slot record with valid CRC but inconsistent term/ballot relative to other state) is detected by replay sanity checks; if found, the node fails out of the affected group.

### 8.4 Network-level data loss is not a WAL concern

The WAL is per-node. Inter-node consistency is the consensus layer's job. If a network drops a record, the leader retransmits; if it drops repeatedly, gap repair handles it.

## 9. Tunables and Defaults

| Parameter | Field in `WalConfig` | Default | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `wal_disks` | `wal_disks` | required | ≥ 1; more → higher throughput |
| `wal_segment_size` | `wal_segment_size` | 64 MiB | Trade GC granularity vs file count |
| `wal_flush_batch_bytes` | `wal_flush_batch_bytes` | 64 KiB | Batch cap per durable flush |
| `wal_flush_watchdog_ms` | `wal_flush_watchdog_ms` | 100 ms | Safety-net timer: wakes idle writer to drain missed wakes |
| `wal_disk_high_watermark_pct` | `wal_disk_high_watermark_pct` | 80% | Triggers eager GC (not yet implemented) |
| `wal_min_retention_secs` | `wal_min_retention_secs` | 3600 (1 h) | Forensics retention (not yet implemented) |
| `gc_tick_secs` | `gc_tick_secs` | 30 s | GC scan cadence |
| `wal_aligned` | `wal_aligned` | false | Selects block-aligned I/O backend |
| `wal_io_unit_bytes` | `wal_io_unit_bytes` | 4096 | IU size when `wal_aligned` is true |
| `wal_record_format` | `wal_record_format` | Auto | Binary (zero-copy) or text-line |
| `wal_early_ack` | `CROWConfig.wal_early_ack` | `true` (gated on `quorum > 1`) | Early-ack mode (§5.4): declare `Chosen` on remote quorum durable flush + leader CAS, deferring the leader's local WAL persist to a background spawn. Default `false` for single-node groups (quorum = 1) — no survivors to re-drive a chosen-but-not-locally-durable slot. |

**Choosing durable-flush batching:**

- Latency-critical, low write rate → defaults (wake-drain-flush; no fixed delay).
- Throughput-oriented → `wal_flush_batch_bytes = 64–512 KiB`.
- WAN replication piggybacking → tune batching only after measuring end-to-end RTT and tail latency.

**Choosing segment size:**

- Few large segments → fewer files, faster replay scan.
- Many small segments → finer-grained GC, more files.
- 64 MiB is the engineering compromise.

**Choosing disk count:**

- 1 disk: single durable-flush limit. Fine for development.
- 2–4 disks: typical production for a write-heavy workload.
- More than 4: usually network or CPU becomes the bottleneck before more disks help.

## 10. Follow-up Implementation Scope

Most of the design above has been implemented. The following items are **not yet
implemented**: disk-pressure-triggered eager GC (§7.3), retention window (§7.5),
and the full fail-out procedure with step-out RPC and reconfiguration (§8.1).
Remaining pending test tasks are tracked in [`plan-test.md`](../working/plan-test.md):

- Slot-affinity WAL placement instead of per-record round-robin.
- Backend-specific durable flush and alignment semantics.
- Event-driven wake-drain-flush workers.
- Replay-only restore for acceptor state, with learner apply gated by durable commit evidence.
- New-leader recovery ceiling, `NoOp` hole fill, and post-recovery `next_slot` seeding.
- Dedup checkpoint documentation and tests.
