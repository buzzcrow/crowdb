# CROWDB - Design: crowdb-tree In-Memory Engine

Depends on: [`design-crowdb-tree.md`](design-crowdb-tree.md), [`../kv/design-crowdb-kv-state-machine.md`](../kv/design-crowdb-kv-state-machine.md) (apply semantics, slot rules)
Satisfies: [`design-crowdb-tree.md`](design-crowdb-tree.md) §2 (in-memory engine architecture)

This document specifies crowdb-tree's in-memory engine: the bounded 2-level
structure (concurrent MemTable over a COW B+tree), the slot-aware value cell,
the write path (apply → delta → consolidate → split/merge), the versioned root
for consistent snapshots, epoch-based reclamation, and the read path. Then the
two supporting layers that make that write/read path zero-copy: the `buffer`
memory-ownership model, and the io_uring async FFI bridge that exposes it to
Rust without blocking.

On-disk format, backends, snapshot persistence, and recovery are in
[`design-crowdb-tree-storage.md`](design-crowdb-tree-storage.md).

## 1. The Tree Engine

### 1.1 Logical Model and the Slot-Aware Cell

crowdb-tree is an ordered map `key → (slot, cell)`, where `key` is an opaque byte
string compared lexicographically, `slot` is the resolved consensus slot, and
`cell` is a live value or a tombstone. It is a **bounded 2-level** structure
(`design-crowdb-tree.md` D3):

- **L0 — MemTable.** A concurrent in-memory ordered map (**`absl::btree_map`**,
  D9) that absorbs `apply` (concurrent, possibly out-of-order by slot; §1.3).
  Keeps one (highest-slot) cell per key. Key/value bytes are stored as
  move-only `buffer`s (§2), not `std::string`, so the write path is
  single-allocation and zero-copy down to the frame build.
- **L1 — B+tree.** A **single-writer / multi-reader** B+tree with
  copy-on-write base pages and a per-leaf delta chain. Inner pages hold
  separator keys + child PIDs; leaf pages hold sorted `(key, slot, cell)`
  entries and a `right_sibling` link for range scans. Reachable from a
  `root_pid` through the mapping table
  ([`design-crowdb-tree-storage.md §8`](design-crowdb-tree-storage.md#8-mapping-table)).

The single **Flusher** thread merges the MemTable's contiguous-applied prefix
into L1 ("flush = the persistent write"; §1.3). Reads overlay L0 on L1 (§1.7),
so read amplification is bounded at 2. The B+tree has exactly one writer.

Every value carries the slot and a kind flag:

```
cell_payload := [slot: u64 LE][flags: u8][value bytes...]
flags bit0 = tombstone (1 → value bytes empty)
```

- **Highest-slot-wins:** on write, if the incoming `slot <= existing slot` for
  a key, the write is skipped (idempotent).
- **Tombstone:** a delete is a cell with the tombstone flag; it occupies space
  until GC removes it below the watermark
  ([`design-crowdb-tree-storage.md §9`](design-crowdb-tree-storage.md#9-garbage-collection)).
  `get` on a tombstone returns `None`; `iter_all` returns the tombstone (for
  `compare`).

This inlining is the single difference from a generic ordered KV engine; it is
why a stock bw-tree cannot be used unmodified.

### 1.2 Pages and Delta Records

A page is the unit of indexing, consolidation, and (when flushed) I/O. Leaf
pages hold sorted key/cell entries plus an optional bloom filter and
`right_sibling` link; inner pages hold separator keys + child PIDs only (no
values), so they stay small and are written only at snapshot. The concrete
on-disk/in-memory frame layout (identical representation, zero-copy) is
specified in
[`design-crowdb-tree-storage.md §3`](design-crowdb-tree-storage.md#3-on-disk-page-format-zero-copy-frame);
this doc only needs the logical shape above.

A **flush** prepends an immutable delta to each affected leaf's chain instead
of rewriting the whole leaf. crowdb-tree needs only one data delta type, the
**batch delta**: one slot's worth of mutations targeting a single leaf,
entries sorted by key, each carrying its own cell. A single flushed slot may
touch several leaves; the Flusher produces one batch delta per affected leaf
(all stamped with the same `slot`; the slot fan-out is the *common* case, not
an edge case). Put and Delete are not separate delta types — a delete is a
tombstone cell inside the batch. SMO deltas (split/merge/index-insert) appear
only transiently during a writer-exclusive split/merge (§1.4); there is no
abort delta because there is no competing writer.

### 1.3 Write Path: MemTable Ingest + Flush

`apply(slot, batch)` does **not** touch the B+tree. It folds the batch into
the concurrent MemTable:

```
apply(slot, batch):
    for (key, op, value) in batch:              // intra-batch: last occurrence wins
        if slot <= last_applied_slot: continue  // already durable in L1; drop
        memtable.try_emplace(std::move(key_buf), std::move(cell_buf))  // move-only
    maybe_signal_flush()                         // size/entry/time threshold crossed
```

- The consensus apply path stores **split cells** — the value is
  borrowed from the payload `Bytes` via a `kExternal` buffer (no value
  memcpy), and the 9-byte cell header is stored as `slot`/`flags` fields
  in `cell_entry`. The contiguous cell is materialized at flush / L0-read.
  See §2.4 for the full design. The pseudocode above shows the
  contiguous-cell path (used by snapshot import and the direct C API);
  both paths coexist in the same MemTable.
- The MemTable keeps **one cell per key** (highest slot wins), so repeated
  writes to a hot key collapse in memory before ever reaching the tree.
- `apply` drops cells already durable in L1 (`slot <= last_applied_slot`) and
  keeps the highest slot per key, so the MemTable always holds cells
  **strictly newer** than L1 for any shared key. This is what makes the
  L0-first read (§1.7) correct.
- A NoOp / empty batch still advances the contiguous frontier via
  `force_advance_slot` (the learner counts it), so the Flusher never blocks on
  the gap a NoOp leaves (`design-crowdb-tree.md §3.1`).

The single Flusher thread, when a size/entry or time threshold trips, drains
the **contiguous-applied prefix** of the MemTable into L1:

```
flush():
    cs = contiguous.load()
    drained = memtable.take_while(entry.slot <= cs)     // ordered by key
    guard = epoch.enter()
    for (pid, group) in group_by_leaf(drained):          // find_leaf(key) per run
        delta = build_batch_delta(flushed_slot = cs, group)
        prepend delta onto pid's chain; mapping.Store(pid, delta)  // sole writer, plain store
        if chain exceeds max_delta_len / max_delta_bytes: consolidate(pid)  // may split/merge
    publish_root_version(version++, root_pid, last_applied_slot = cs)   // §1.5
```

- Every cell in a flush has `slot <= cs <= last_applied_slot`, so the
  published `RootVersion` is an **exact point-in-time** state (§1.5); no
  slot beyond the frontier ever reaches the tree. `flush` *is* snapshot
  creation *is* snapshot: the public API is unified under snapshot
  terminology (`create_snapshot` = drain + publish + **persist to disk**),
  and `snapshot_view` returns the latest pinned root rather than
  materializing a copy. Every snapshot is durable; there is no
  "in-memory-only flush." Recovery uses the latest durable snapshot's slot as
  the replay starting point.
- The Flusher is the sole tree mutator, so mapping stores need no CAS; a
  multi-leaf flush is atomic to readers per leaf (each head swap is one
  atomic store), and the L0 overlay (§1.7) covers any cross-leaf read
  consistency during the flush.
- **Highest-slot-wins placement** is resolved consistently in three places:
  MemTable upsert (memory), consolidation (chain fold), and read (L0 overlay
  + chain scan). A higher-slot cell always shadows a lower-slot one.
- **Batching benefit:** hot keys collapse in the MemTable; each flush does
  one atomic store + at most one consolidation per affected leaf per flushed
  slot, not per key. This is LSM-style write batching without global
  compaction.

### 1.4 Consolidation, Split, and Merge

When a leaf's delta chain exceeds `max_delta_len` (default 8) or
`max_delta_bytes` (default 256 KiB), the chain is folded into a fresh leaf
base page: replay the chain (highest slot wins per key, the authoritative
point where the slot rule is enforced; tombstones are preserved, removed only
by GC), then either build a new base page, or split/merge if the result
crosses a size threshold.

Because there is exactly one writer, the multi-phase cooperative SMO protocol
of the pagetree reference is **dropped**: split/merge is a writer-exclusive
in-place restructure followed by atomic mapping-table stores.

- **Split** (leaf exceeds the target page size): partition entries at a
  cumulative-byte midpoint, build left/right leaves, splice `right` into the
  sibling chain, insert a new separator into the parent (may recurse/split
  the parent).
- **Merge** (leaf falls below `merge_threshold`, default target/4,
  non-root): absorb into the left sibling if the combined size still fits,
  rebuild, remove the parent's separator, free the old PID.

Inner pages split/merge by the same logic (separator keys + child PIDs, no
values). Root collapses when it has a single child; root grows a new level
when an inner split propagates past the current root. Thresholds use a
hysteresis gap (split at target, merge at target/4) to avoid split-merge
oscillation.

### 1.5 Versioned Root (Consistent Snapshots)

Steady-state reads use epoch pinning (§1.6) on the live chain. For
**long-lived consistent views** (`scan` with a large result, `compare`,
`snapshot_export`, and recovery anchoring), crowdb-tree maintains an immutable
**versioned root**: `{version, root_pid, last_applied_slot, refcount}`.

- At `persist_snapshot` (and optionally on a cadence), the writer **freezes**
  the current tree: consolidates dirty leaves into immutable base pages,
  records a new `RootVersion`, and makes it current. This is the
  copy-on-write boundary.
- A reader takes `snapshot_view()` → pins the current `RootVersion`
  (refcount++). All `EngineView` methods read that fixed tree; writes after
  the pin allocate new pages and never mutate the pinned version's pages.
- A `RootVersion` (and pages reachable only from it) is reclaimable when
  `refcount == 0` **and** `last_applied_slot < gc watermark`
  ([`design-crowdb-tree-storage.md §9`](design-crowdb-tree-storage.md#9-garbage-collection)).

This gives true MVCC snapshots for readers/export without multi-version
per-key storage: only whole *tree versions* are retained briefly, not
multiple versions per key. Steady state keeps just one live version; older
versions exist only while a long reader holds them. Snapshot export always
pins the **current** version; exporting an arbitrary past slot is not
supported. Install-snapshot always installs the latest durable state.

### 1.6 Epoch-Based Reclamation

Page lifetime (deletion / references / safe concurrent access) is governed by
an epoch manager **owned by each `Crowdbtree` instance** (not shared): because
the buffer pool and all retired pages are already tree-private, a per-tree
epoch is simpler and lets `get`/`scan` hand back **borrowed zero-copy views**
into resident frames that stay valid for the read guard's lifetime (§2.2).

- A reader does `Enter()` (a single atomic store) before touching any page and
  exits when its guard drops.
- The writer `Retire()`s pages it replaces (old delta chains, old base pages,
  freed leaf/inner pages from split/merge, unreferenced `RootVersion` pages).
- A retired page is freed only after every thread that could hold a pointer
  has left the epoch in which it was retired.

Because there is a single writer, `Retire` is uncontended; readers pay only
the enter/exit. This is the one mechanism that answers page deletion, page
references, and concurrent-read performance together.

**`enter()`/`exit()` are lock-free** (a single atomic store each; no mutex,
no CAS). The writer path (`retire`/`reclaim`) keeps a mutex since there is
only one writer (the Flusher), so no contention there. This follows the classic
epoch-based reclamation (EBR) design (Fraser, *Practical Lock-Freedom*, 2004;
the same idea underlies Linux kernel RCU and Rust's `crossbeam-epoch`): a
monotonic global epoch, per-thread local-epoch slots (cache-padded,
fixed-capacity pool, no dynamic allocation on the hot path), and reclamation
deferred to whichever thread calls `try_reclaim()` (the writer or a periodic
tick), which frees any retired entry whose epoch is below the minimum active
participant's epoch.

**Why not sharding instead?** Sharding (multiple `EpochManager` instances,
reader hashed by thread) reduces contention but does not eliminate it. Each
shard still needs a mutex, and retire/reclaim must coordinate across shards
(take the min epoch across all of them). Lock-free EBR eliminates the mutex
entirely on the reader path, which is strictly better, for less complexity.

**Why epoch-based reclamation and not pin counts or hazard pointers?** The
hard part of eviction/reclamation is not picking a victim; it is answering
*"when is it safe to actually reuse a page's frame bytes?"* Readers are
lock-free and read `Slice`s that point **directly into a frame**, so freeing
or reusing memory a reader still holds a pointer into is a use-after-free.
Three disciplines solve this:

1. **Pin counts / refcounting** (textbook buffer pool): `pin++` before
   touching a page, `pin--` after; evict only at `pin == 0`. Correct, but it
   puts an atomic RMW on a shared cacheline on **every page touch on the read
   hot path**, a real regression versus lock-free reads.
2. **Hazard pointers:** a reader publishes each pointer it dereferences into
   a per-thread slot before touching it; the reclaimer scans all threads'
   slots before freeing. Lock-free and tightly memory-bounded, but the reader
   pays a publish (store + fence + re-validation) per pointer, and a
   root→…→leaf descent needs one hazard per level.
3. **Epoch-based reclamation (EBR)**, crowdb-tree's choice for the sync read
   hot path (`get`/`scan`/`get_view`). A reader brackets its **whole**
   operation in one `Guard`; it never publishes which pointers it holds.
   Reader cost is one enter/exit *per operation*, not per pointer. Trade-off
   vs. hazard pointers: a single stalled guard blocks *all* reclamation
   (worst-case unbounded retained memory), accepted because reads are short
   (one `get`/`scan`) and there is a single writer, so the active-epoch
   window is tiny.
4. **Per-page refcount on handoff paths**, composes with EBR as an
   orthogonal cross-thread lifetime mechanism. EBR protects the same-thread
   walk (the `Guard` is thread-bound); refcount extends page lifetime across
   threads after the walk hands off a borrowed `Slice` (`get_async` slow
   path) or a pinned snapshot (`snapshot_view` → `PinnedSnapshot`). The
   per-page `pin_state_` atomic on `PageBase` is only touched on the
   handoff paths (one `fetch_add` on pin, one `fetch_sub` on unpin), NOT on
   the sync `get`/`scan` hot path. The §1.6 rejection of refcount ("atomic
   RMW on every page touch on the read hot path") stands for the hot path.
   The epoch deleter sets a `kRetiredBit` via `fetch_or`; if pins are
   outstanding (count > 0), the deleter defers and the last `unpin` frees.
   This decouples page lifetime from the entering thread's participant slot,
   eliminating the copy in `materialize_owned` and the stale-root GC delay
   when a snapshot is handed to another thread.

### 1.7 Read Path

```
get(key):
    guard = epoch.enter()                 // keeps frames resident
    if cell = memtable.get(key):          // L0 first: holds the newest cell if present
        return cell.tombstone ? None : (cell.slot, cell.value.clone())  // L0 must COPY (mutex)
    pid  = find_leaf(key)                  // L1: descend inner pages from root_pid
    for node in chain(pid):                // head → base
        if node has key: return cell_of(node) (tombstone → None)
    return None
```

- **L0 overlay.** Because `apply` drops cells `<= last_applied_slot` and keeps
  the highest slot per key (§1.3), any key present in the MemTable has a slot
  strictly newer than L1, so checking L0 first is correct (read amplification
  2).
- `scan(prefix, start_after, limit)` uses a **merge cursor** over L0 and the
  L1 leaf chain: at each step take the smaller key, and on a key tie take the
  L0 cell (newer). Within L1, walk the current leaf's live entries with a
  `LeafChainCursor` (resolving the delta chain by highest slot), then follow
  `right_sibling`.
  For bounded `limit` the live overlay is fine; for large scans the cursor
  runs on a pinned `RootVersion` merged with an L0 snapshot. `start_after`
  (empty = start from beginning) is an **exclusive lower bound** pushed down
  into the engine: the descent targets the leaf that would contain
  `start_after` (instead of the prefix start), and the merge loop skips keys
  `<= start_after` natively, so a deep-pagination scan starts at the cursor
  and applies the limit without over-fetching the prefix range. O(limit)
  FFI + decode cost instead of O(prefix range) for a page near the end of a
  large prefix.
- **Lazy leaf resolution (`LeafChainCursor`).** A leaf chain is *never*
  materialized for a scan. Every chain input is already key-sorted: each
  `BatchDelta`'s entries, and the terminal `LeafBase`'s main frame slots,
  except the in-frame delta overlay, which is bounded by `max_inframe_delta`
  and pre-sorted once at cursor setup. The cursor merges those `k` streams
  (`k <= max_delta_len + 2`) by linear min-key selection over the stream
  heads, resolving highest-slot-wins per key as it goes, so producing one
  entry costs O(k) and a `limit`-bounded scan never touches the rest of the
  leaf. On an equal slot the winner is the stream visited earliest in chain
  order (deltas head→tail, then the base's main entries, then its in-frame
  overlay), the same resolution order a whole-chain fold would apply.
  `seek()` binary-searches each stream, so the descent leaf's entries before
  `start_after` / `prefix` are skipped rather than stepped over. Keys and
  cells come out as Slices borrowed from the chain's own storage and are
  copied only when an entry is actually emitted to the caller.
  The whole-chain form (`resolve_chain_sorted`) is the same cursor drained
  into an owned vector; it remains the right shape for the full-set callers
  (`iter_all` / `compare`, `PinnedSnapshot::materialize`, GC's live walk).
- **Zero-copy value returns.** An **L1** hit returns a *borrowed* `buffer`
  pointing into the resident leaf frame (valid only for the guard's
  lifetime, §2.2). An **L0** hit also returns a *borrowed* `buffer`
  pointing directly into the MemTable's skip-list node cell version. The
  epoch guard keeps the node alive past any concurrent overwrite/drain,
  exactly as it keeps an L1 frame resident. An overflow value (assembled
  from multiple pages, no single frame to borrow) is materialized into an
  owned `buffer`.
- `iter_all` (for `compare`) always runs on a pinned `RootVersion` (merged
  with an L0 snapshot) and includes tombstones.

Reads never block apply and apply never blocks reads: readers see immutable
pages; the writer only ever publishes new pages via atomic stores and retires
old ones via the epoch manager.

### 1.8 Concurrency Summary

| Actor | Mechanism |
| --- | --- |
| MemTable ingest (`apply`, ≥ 1) | Concurrent ordered-map upsert; no tree access |
| Flusher (1 per tree) | Sole tree writer: drain prefix → batch delta → plain store; epoch retire |
| Point/range readers (N) | Epoch enter/exit; L0 overlay + lock-free atomic loads of immutable pages |
| Long readers / export | Pin a `RootVersion` (refcount) + L0 snapshot for a stable MVCC view |

Invariants:

- **I1** A page is freed only after no reader epoch can reference it.
- **I2** A pinned `RootVersion`'s pages are immutable until its refcount hits 0.
- **I3** Per-key resolved slot is monotone (highest-slot-wins at upsert, read
  & consolidate).
- **I4** A reader observes a linearizable point-in-time state (L0 overlay on
  the live tree, or a pinned version), never a partial multi-leaf flush.
- **I5** For any key in both, the MemTable cell's slot is strictly newer than
  L1's (apply drops `slot <= last_applied_slot`), so L0-first reads are
  correct.
- **I6** The B+tree only ever holds slots `<= last_applied_slot` (flush
  drains the contiguous prefix only), so every `RootVersion` is an exact
  point-in-time state.

### 1.9 Epoch-Protected MemTable (L0)

The MemTable (L0) is a `ConcurrentSkipList` with inline keys and versioned
cell pointers, epoch-retired exactly as L1 pages are. This brings L0 into
the same EBR scheme as L1, closing the gap that previously forced
`snapshot()` to deep-copy every live L0 entry on every scan.

**Structure.** Each skip-list node holds a `next[]` tower of
`std::atomic<Node*>`, an atomic `CellVersion*` pointer, a logical-deleted
flag, and the key bytes inline in the node's tail allocation (RocksDB
`InlineSkipList` style: one allocation, no `std::string` header). Height
is drawn at insert (p=0.25, max 12). Keys are immutable for a node's
lifetime; only the cell version pointer is mutable, which makes the read
path a pure atomic load.

**Cell version.** A `CellVersion` holds the `buffer` (contiguous
`[header][value]` or split `kExternal` raw value) + slot + flags. Overwrite
publishes a new `CellVersion*` with a release store, then
`epoch_.retire(old_version)`. A reader that loaded the old pointer under
its guard keeps it alive, no use-after-free. This is the key difference
from the previous in-place overwrite.

**Write path.** Writers are serialized by a write spinlock (replacing the
old `mu_`). `apply()` already serialized on `mu_` and is not the scan
bottleneck; CAS-based concurrent insert is out of scope. Insert splices
the node in bottom-up with release stores. Erase (`drain_up_to`) sets
`deleted`, unlinks the tower, then epoch-retires the node and cell version.
`reset()` epoch-retires every node. `upsert_external` always tags the
buffer as `kExternal` (split cell) since it stores the raw value without
the 9-byte header. The header is reconstructed from `slot`/`flags` at
read time.

**Read path.** `MemTable::cursor(start_after)` returns a cursor seeded by
an O(log N) `lower_bound`, exposing `key()`, `cell_version()`, `advance()`.
Traversal is atomic acquire loads on `next[]`; logically-deleted nodes are
skipped. The scan's `L0Cursor` is a skip-list cursor; the merge loop is
otherwise unchanged (min-key select, highest-slot-wins on collision, early
stop past prefix). Cell materialization runs only for entries that reach
the output: O(limit), not O(N_l0). The `upper_bound` skip pass and its
`scan_l0_skip_l` metric are deleted; the cursor seeks directly.
`get_view()` and `try_get_view_no_load()` borrow the value directly from
the `CellVersion`, no `std::string` staging, no second copy.

**Counters.** `bytes_`, `min_slot_`, `max_slot_`, `count()`, and `empty()`
are relaxed atomics maintained by the writer (read by
`maybe_freeze_active`'s thresholds and diagnostics).

**`snapshot()` retained.** `iter_all`, `compare`, and `snapshot_export`
need every entry, O(N) is correct there. `snapshot()` is a cursor walk;
the point of L0 is that it is no longer on the scan or get path.

### 1.10 Scan Path Perf Baseline

Scan is part of the read flow but a separate perf track from random
point reads (different cost shapes: per-entry overhead vs leaf-chain
traversal vs per-byte copy). The regression sentinel is
`tools/bench-kv-scan-regression.sh` driving `crowdb-cli bench run --workload
list` with `--scan-limit`, `--scan-prefix`, `--scan-start-after` flags
against a 3-node mem-mode cluster, mirroring the write/read regression
sentinels. The sync `scan` `start_after` pushdown correctness is
covered by `ReadPath.ScanStartAfterCursorSkipsEarlierEntries` in
`read_path_test.cpp`. Full baseline numbers and analysis are in
`doc/design/kv/kv-scan-flow-analysis.md`; the raw TSV is in
`doc/working/bench-scan-regression.tsv`.

Key findings from the baseline (Apple M5 Pro, macOS, 1T:1C, 100k
pre-populated keys):

- **§1.7 O(limit) deep-pagination claim: confirmed.** Deep pagination
  (`start_after` near end, limit=10) is 1.7x slower than from-start
  (7084us vs 4236us): the O(log N) B+tree descent to a deeper leaf,
  not O(prefix) over-fetch. If the engine over-fetched the prefix,
  deep pagination would cost ~1.75s (the full-100k number), not 7ms.
  The over-fetch proxy ratio is 1.7x; the etcd-style "fetch all then
  truncate" regression would show ~400x.
- **Per-scan fixed cost** (~4.2ms): ReadIndex consensus round + crowdb-rpc
  roundtrip + B+tree descent. Dominates at small limit (10/100).
- **Per-entry cost** (~0.3us/entry at 64B values): visible at limit
  >= 10k. At limit=10k, avg=7.3ms vs 4.4ms at limit=10.
- **crowdb-rpc 4 MiB message size limit**: scans returning > 4 MiB (full
  100k keyspace at 64B values, or limit=1000 at 16KiB values) hit
  crowdb-rpc's default `max_recv_message_length` and fail with transport
  errors. This is the crowdb-rpc-message-size analog of etcd's range-read
  OOM risk (issue #12342). A streaming scan response (mirroring etcd
  PR #19766) or a raised max-message-size config is needed for
  large-payload scans.
- **Value-size anomaly (resolved)**: 1KiB values scanned 3.8x faster
  than 64B despite returning 16x more data. The L0-snapshot hypothesis
  was refuted by per-step measurement: `l0_snapshot` is 0us in
  production (the maintenance loop drains L0 before measurement), and
  even a full 100k-entry 64B snapshot is only ~120us against a ~3900us
  scan. The real cause was eager whole-leaf resolution: `l1_resolve`
  was 99.5% of the 64B C++ scan (3985us of 4004us) and 93% of the 1KiB
  scan, because a leaf's entire live entry set was rebuilt per scan
  regardless of `limit`. 64B values pack ~640 entries per 64 KiB leaf
  vs ~58 for 1KiB, so the dense-leaf case paid ~11x more per leaf.
  The lazy `LeafChainCursor` (§1.7) makes per-leaf cost O(limit):
  microbench 100k keys, limit=1000, L1-only: 64B 1183us → 19.9us,
  1KiB 476us → 32.2us; limit=10 at 64B 1163us → 0.4us. Cost now tracks
  bytes returned rather than entries per leaf, so 64B is cheaper than
  1KiB, as expected.

Per-step scan instrumentation (`Crowdbtree::scan_profile()`, the `scan.*`
metrics, and the `scan_step_profile` microbench under
`-DCROWDB_TREE_BENCH=ON`) is what made this attributable: `l0_snapshot`,
`l0_skip`, `l1_descent`, `l1_resolve`, `merge`, `total`. `l1_resolve`
now covers per-leaf cursor setup + seek only; the per-entry cursor step
is counted under `merge`, since timing each step would cost more than
the step.

Cost-split prioritization: with leaf resolution O(limit), the remaining
scan cost is per-entry decode/copy plus the per-scan fixed cost
(ReadIndex consensus round + crowdb-rpc roundtrip + descent, ~0.4-0.6ms),
which dominates every bounded scan. The crowdb-rpc 4 MiB limit caps practical
scan width before per-byte copy becomes dominant, so response-size work
(pagination + byte budget) gates large-value scans more than per-byte
copy does.

Future gaps (not measured by the baseline): high-concurrency
read-mode split (MinSlot vs Linearizable at > 1T:1C), and reverse scan
(forward-only today). The L0 snapshot copy (O(N_l0) per scan) was closed
by the L0 path; see §1.9.

## 2. Memory and Buffer Management

The write path used to copy key/value bytes **three times**: `encode_cell()`
into a `std::string`, `MemTable::upsert` storing the string, `flush()`
draining into a vector, and the frame builder writing into the frame. **Goal:
allocate key/value memory once, at the earliest point (the Rust/C API
boundary), then move it down to the MemTable and into the B+tree without
copying.** The only unavoidable copy is the final placement into the slotted
frame layout. That copy *is* page construction, not a redundant one. On the
read side, `get`/`scan` hand back a **borrowed** view into the resident frame
instead of a freshly-allocated `std::string`; the caller copies only if it
needs to outlive the read guard.

### 2.1 The `buffer` Abstraction

`buffer` (`lib/crowdb-tree/include/lib/crowdb-tree/buffer.h`) is a move-only byte container
that is *either* owned (frees on destruction) *or* borrowed (a non-owning view
whose lifetime is guaranteed elsewhere — a resident frame under an epoch
guard). Design rules:

- **Move-only.** A `buffer` is never implicitly copied; passing it down the
  write path is a `std::move`. Deep copies are explicit (`clone()`).
- **Two modes, one type.** The same type serves an owned write-path value and
  a borrowed read-path view. A borrowed `buffer` never frees.
- **Header reserve.** `alloc(cap, header_reserve)` over-allocates by
  `header_reserve` so the cell header (`[slot][flags]`, §1.1) is written in
  the reserved prefix and the value bytes follow contiguously — the encoded
  cell is one contiguous buffer with no second allocation or copy.
- **Small-buffer optimization (SBO) — required, not optional.** An owned
  `buffer` whose total length fits `kInlineCap` (24 B) stores its bytes
  **inline**, with no heap allocation, mirroring `std::string`'s SSO. This is
  a *correctness-for-performance* rule: without it, replacing `std::string`
  (which inlines ~15 B) with `buffer` on the write path would *regress* the
  common small-key/small-value case by forcing a `malloc` where there was
  none. A 9-byte cell header + up to 15 B of value stays inline.
- **Allocator seam.** `alloc()` routes owned allocations larger than
  `kInlineCap` through a single internal allocator hook (today: glibc
  `malloc`); a size-classed pool or RDMA-pinned allocator could slot in here
  later with no call-site changes. See [`todo_code.md`](../todo_code.md) for
  why that hasn't been done speculatively.
- **MemTable = `absl::btree_map<std::string, cell_entry>`.** The KEY stays
  `std::string`, the VALUE is a `cell_entry{slot, flags, cell}`. The
  `cell` buffer is either **contiguous** (`kOwned`, full `[header][value]`,
  used by snapshot import and the direct C API) or **split** (`kExternal`,
  value-only borrowed from a Rust `Bytes`, the zero-copy consensus apply
  path). The contiguous form is materialized at the API boundary
  (`get`/`drain`/`snapshot`). **Why the key is not a `buffer`:** a B-tree stores
  `pair<const Key, Value>` and *relocates* slots on node split/merge, which
  requires moving the `const` key. A move-only `buffer` key falls back to
  its deleted copy ctor and fails to compile. `std::string`'s SSO already
  inlines small keys, so it is the correct key type; `buffer`'s SBO gives
  the same inline benefit on the value side plus the borrowed read path.
  `std::less<>` is transparent → heterogeneous `Slice`/`string_view`
  lookup with no temporary key.

### 2.2 Write and Read Pipelines

```
Write (consensus apply path — zero-copy):
  Rust: Batch::decode produces Bytes slices (O(1) Arc ref-bump)
  → CrowdbTreeEngine::apply: per-op Bytes::clone → BytesRef handle (Arc bump)
  → ct_apply_batch_external: C++ wraps value as kExternal buffer (NO memcpy)
  → apply_external → MemTable::upsert_external: cell_entry{slot, flags, value:kExternal}
  → [payload Bytes stays alive, pinned by external buffers' Arc clones]

Write (contiguous-cell path — snapshot import / direct C API):
  → allocate one buffer (value + reserved cell header)          ← the ONE allocation
  → C FFI: ct_apply_put(tree, slot, key_ptr,klen, val_ptr,vlen)
  → C++ wraps as buffer (copy at the boundary; §2.3)
  → encode cell: write slot+flags into the reserved header       (no alloc, no copy)
  → MemTable::upsert(key_buf, cell_buf): std::move into the map   (no copy)

Flush (off the apply critical path):
  → drain_up_to: materialize split cells → contiguous [header][value] (value memcpy HERE)
  → frame builder copies bytes into the slotted frame layout     ← unavoidable (page construction)

Read: get(key):
  guard = epoch.enter()                       // keeps resident frames alive (§1.6)
  L0 (MemTable) hit: must COPY (materializes split cell into [header][value]; one copy)
  L1 (B+tree) hit:   return buffer::wrap(cell_value_ptr_in_frame, len)  // BORROWED, zero copy
                      valid only while `guard` is held AND the frame stays resident
```

- **Apply critical path: zero value memcpy.** The value bytes are borrowed
  from the Paxos payload `Bytes` via `kExternal` buffers; the `memcpy` is
  deferred to flush (off the critical path). The total value-copy count is
  2 (materialization at flush + frame construction), both on the Flusher
  thread, none on the apply thread.
- **L1 reads are zero-copy:** the returned `buffer` borrows the cell's value
  bytes directly from the resident frame. **The epoch guard alone keeps the
  frame resident.** Eviction does not free a page's frame directly, it
  re-tags the mapping slot unloaded and epoch-retires the page, whose
  destructor (which releases the frame) only runs after the epoch reclaims
  it. A reader holding a guard therefore keeps the page alive, so the frame
  stays pinned and the buffer pool's CLOCK sweep skips it; no separate pin
  needs to be bundled into the returned handle.
- **Caller contract:** a borrowed `buffer` is valid only while the caller
  holds the read guard. To retain a value past the guard, the caller calls
  `clone()` (owned copy) and releases the guard.

### 2.3 Rust FFI Ownership

Three options for how Rust hands value memory to C++:

- **Option A — copy at the boundary.** Rust passes `*const u8` + len; C++
  `buffer::alloc()`s and copies once at the FFI boundary. Simpler; one
  copy remains at the boundary but the *internal* pipeline is zero-copy
  (§2.2). Used by the simple single-op C API (`ct_apply_put`,
  `ct_apply_batch`, `ct_apply_batch_slices`).
- **Option B — handle-based ownership transfer.** The caller
  allocates crowdb-tree-owned memory via `ct_alloc(key_len, val_len)`, which
  returns an opaque `ct_write_handle` plus two writable pointers (key +
  value). The caller writes key/value bytes directly into that memory,
  then `ct_apply_put_owned(tree, slot, handle)` writes the cell header
  (slot + flags) into the pre-allocated cell and moves key+cell into
  `apply_encoded` — zero value memcpy. `ct_free_handle(handle)` is the
  error/cancel path. The cell header layout (`kCellHeaderSize`) is
  internal — the C API never exposes it, sidestepping the ABI-stability
  concern that originally blocked this option. The Rust adapter wraps the
  handle in a `WriteHandle` struct with RAII `Drop` (frees if not
  consumed) and `apply(self, slot)` (consumes). `!Send + !Sync`. SBO is
  preserved: small values (≤ 15 B) use inline storage, same as Option A.
  Intended for direct API callers that want zero-copy single-op apply.
- **Option C — external borrow from Rust `Bytes`.** The consensus
  apply path (`CrowdbTreeEngine::apply`) uses `ct_apply_batch_external`:
  each Put op's value `Bytes` is cloned (O(1) `Arc` bump) into a
  `BytesRef` handle handed to C++. C++ wraps the value bytes as a
  `kExternal` `buffer` (borrowed, no memcpy) and stores a **split cell**
  in the MemTable — `cell_entry{slot, flags, value:kExternal}` — where
  the 9-byte cell header is stored as fields, not as adjacent bytes. The
  contiguous `[header][value]` cell is materialized at the MemTable API
  boundary (`get`/`drain_up_to`/`snapshot`), where a copy already exists,
  all off the apply critical path. When the `kExternal` buffer is freed
  (drain/overwrite), C++ calls back into Rust (`ct_release_bytes`) to
  drop the `Arc<Bytes>` clone, keeping the payload allocation alive until
  every borrowing buffer is freed. The `kExternal` mode adds zero size
  overhead to `buffer` (the drop-control fields overlap the SBO `inbuf_`
  array via a union). See §2.4.

Ownership rule (extends `design-crowdb-tree.md §4`): a buffer *yielded* to
`ct_apply_*` is owned by the tree and freed by it once flushed into a frame;
a buffer *borrowed* into a call (not yielded) follows the existing "borrowed
for the call's duration" rule. An **external** buffer (Option C) is
borrowed from Rust and kept alive by an `Arc<Bytes>` refcount — C++ calls
back into Rust to drop the ref when the buffer is freed (drain/overwrite),
so the payload allocation survives until every borrowing buffer is released.

### 2.4 Zero-Copy Apply: Split-Cell External Buffers

**Design challenge.** The consensus apply path receives value bytes as
`Bytes` slices into the packed Paxos payload, a single refcounted
allocation shared by all ops in the batch. The contiguous-cell apply path
(Option A/B) calls `encode_cell_buf`, which performs a value `memcpy`
(64 KiB for a large value) on the apply thread, the dominant per-op cost
for large values. The goal is to eliminate this copy for the consensus
apply path without changing the contiguous cell representation downstream.

**Why a naive external buffer doesn't work.** The cell is stored as one
contiguous `buffer` `[9-byte header][value]` everywhere (`mem_entry.cell`,
`leaf_entry.cell`, B+tree frames, snapshot I/O). `CellView` reads
`slot()`/`flags()`/`value()` by slicing this contiguous memory. A
`Bytes`-backed external buffer cannot satisfy this contiguity: the value
bytes live in the packed payload `Bytes`, and the 9-byte header (known only
at apply time) is not adjacent to them.

**Design.** Split the cell **only while it lives in the MemTable**;
materialize the contiguous form at the memtable API boundary
(`get`/`drain_up_to`/`snapshot`), points where a copy already exists, all
off the apply critical path. Everything downstream (flush, delta, frame,
`leaf_entry`, `CellView`, snapshot I/O) sees contiguous cells unchanged.

- **`buffer::mode::kExternal`** — a buffer mode that borrows value bytes
  from a Rust `Bytes` and calls `drop_fn(owner)` on destruction to
  decrement the Rust refcount. The drop-control fields (`drop_fn`, `owner`)
  overlap the SBO `inbuf_` array via a union — zero size overhead.
  `clone()` deep-copies the borrowed bytes into an owned buffer; move
  transfers `ext_` and releases the source without calling `drop_fn`.
- **`cell_entry`** — the MemTable's internal map value: `{slot, flags, cell}`.
  Contiguous: `cell` is `kOwned` (full `[header][value]`). Split: `cell` is
  `kExternal` (value-only, borrowed). Tag: `cell.ownership() == kExternal`.
  `materialize()` builds a contiguous `[header][value]` buffer from the
  fields + borrowed value (one value `memcpy`, off the apply hot path).
- **`apply_external(slot, vector<external_op>)`** — same semantics as
  `apply_encoded` (oversized-key rejection, slot bookkeeping,
  `maybe_swap_active`, intra-batch last-key-wins) but builds `cell_entry`
  directly — no `encode_cell_buf`, no value `memcpy`.
- **`ct_apply_batch_external`** — C API: `ct_ext_op{key, value, kind,
  bytes_ref, drop_fn}`. Rust hands a `BytesRef` (boxed `Arc<Bytes>`) per Put
  op; C++ wraps the value as `kExternal` and calls `drop_fn(bytes_ref)` when
  the buffer is freed.
- **`CrowdbTreeEngine::apply`** — unchanged `KVEngine::apply` trait; builds
  `ExtOp`s from the `Batch`'s `Bytes` slices (O(1) `Arc::clone` per op) and
  calls `apply_batch_external`. WAL replay goes through the same
  `learner.learn` → `apply_entry` path, so it benefits automatically.

## 3. Async FFI Bridge

### 3.1 Problem and Design Principle

Wrapping every synchronous C++ engine call in `tokio::task::spawn_blocking`
has two problems: (1) every `get`/`apply`/`scan` hops through Tokio's blocking
thread pool, and the ~5–10 μs scheduling overhead is significant relative to
a μs-level in-memory operation; (2) a high-performance engine must not block
async workers or rely on large thread pools for I/O. `spawn_blocking` is a
workaround for synchronous I/O, not a long-term architecture.

**Design principle: completion-based async I/O via io_uring. No blocking, no
thread pools, no C++ coroutine dependency.**

- **C++ coroutine (`co_await`) is not used.** It would add compiler/runtime
  surface and lifetime complexity at the C ABI without improving the kernel
  I/O path. The boundary still needs an opaque handle Rust can poll, so
  exposing coroutine state machines across FFI is the wrong abstraction.
- **Folly futures are not used.** They bring a large dependency stack and an
  executor model that duplicates Tokio on the Rust side; crowdb-tree only needs
  a small completion object plus a notification fd.
- **epoll is only the readiness fallback.** io_uring handles disk/block I/O;
  `eventfd` handles C++→Rust wakeup, and Tokio already integrates that fd via
  `AsyncFd` (epoll internally), so no separate epoll event loop for storage I/O.

### 3.2 Architecture

```
  Tokio async runtime                         C++ engine
  ┌──────────────────┐                ┌──────────────────────────┐

  │  → Ready(result) │                │  return ct_buf           │
  └──────────────────┘                └──────────────────────────┘
```

One DiskIOUring per `Crowdbtree` instance, on a dedicated C++ thread: it calls
`io_uring_enter` (blocking until a CQE arrives or a timeout fires), peeks
CQEs, dispatches each completion callback, then writes to its `eventfd` to
wake the Rust side. The Rust side wraps that `eventfd` in Tokio's `AsyncFd`;
a `ct_future` handle carries the pending state, result, and (for the fast
path) an `EpochManager::Guard` keeping the frame resident (§3.4).

### 3.3 Fast Path vs Slow Path

| Operation | Fast path (sync) | Slow path (io_uring) |
|-----------|-----------------|---------------------|
| `get` | L0 MemTable hit, L1 resident page hit | L1 cache miss → demand-load from disk |
| `scan` | All pages resident | Any page needs demand-load |
| `apply_put` / `apply_delete` | MemTable insert (no flush triggered) | Triggers flush → write to disk |
| `flush` / `snapshot` | — | Always: write dirty pages to disk |
| `snapshot_view` | All pages resident | Any page needs demand-load |

The C++ engine determines the path internally: if the operation can complete
without I/O, it fills the future synchronously (`state = kDone`) and returns;
otherwise it submits SQE(s) to the DiskIOUring (`state = kPending`) and the
DiskIOUring completes the future when I/O finishes. A `CtFuture`'s first
`poll()` on the fast path resolves immediately, zero scheduling overhead,
no thread switch; on the slow path it registers a waker on `AsyncFd` and
resolves on the next DiskIOUring-driven wakeup.

### 3.4 Zero-Copy Value Across FFI

- **Fast path (PinnedValue):** the `ct_future` holds an
  `EpochManager::Guard` that keeps the frame resident;
  `ct_future_poll` returns a `ct_buf` pointing directly into the frame
  bytes (borrowed, not owned). `AsyncCrowdbtree::try_get_pinned` wraps
  this in a `PinnedValue`, a `!Send` RAII type that holds the
  `ct_future` handle so the epoch guard stays alive until `PinnedValue`
  is dropped. `PinnedValue::as_bytes()` borrows directly from the C++
  frame with no `copy_buf` allocation. The `KVEngine::get_bytes` trait
  method (default impl delegates to `get` + `Bytes::from(vec)`;
  `CrowdbTreeEngine` overrides to use `try_get_pinned`) copies from
  `PinnedValue` into `Bytes` before dropping the pin, eliminating the
  intermediate `Vec<u8>` allocation. Total: one copy (frame → `Bytes`),
  one allocation (`Bytes`), no `Vec<u8>`.
- **Slow path:** the I/O read fills a C++-owned buffer; on completion
  the future returns it as an owned `ct_buf` (C++ allocates, Rust
  frees). For frame-borrowed values, the zero-copy path replaces the copy with a per-page
  refcount pin: the polling thread pins the leaf base page(s) under its
  epoch guard, releases the guard, and hands the `GetView` (still borrowing
  the frame) across threads; `ct_future_free` unpins from the dropping
  thread. `materialize_owned` remains only for overflow-chain values
  (assembled from multiple pages, no single frame to borrow). The Rust
  side then copies from the borrowed/owned buffer into `Vec<u8>` / `Bytes`.
- **Key copy elimination:** `AsyncCrowdbtree::try_get` /
  `try_get_pinned` accept `&[u8]` instead of `Vec<u8>`, since
  `ct_get_async` copies the key internally into a
  `std::shared_ptr<std::string>`. The Rust-side `key.to_vec()` is
  eliminated, no C++ changes required.
- **True zero-copy:** `PinnedValue::into_bytes()` creates a `Bytes`
  via `Bytes::from_owner` backed by the C++ frame, no copy. The
  `ct_future` handle (and its page refcount pins) is held by the `Bytes`
  owner; when the last `Bytes` ref clone is dropped on any thread, the
  owner's `Drop` runs, which drops the `PinnedValue`, which calls
  `ct_future_free` to unpin. `PinnedValue` is `Send` (the per-page
  refcount is thread-independent), enabling this cross-thread zero-copy
  handoff. `CrowdbTreeEngine::get_bytes` uses this path directly.

### 3.5 Decision Log

| ID | Decision | Rationale |
|----|----------|-----------|
| D-Async1 | **Async FFI via io_uring + completion-based futures.** No `spawn_blocking`, no large thread pools, no C++ coroutine/Folly dependency. | A `ct_future` handle is the correct FFI abstraction for Rust polling; C++ coroutine and Folly executor state must not cross the C ABI. Fast path completes synchronously with zero scheduling overhead. |
| D-Async2 | **One polling thread per `Crowdbtree`.** | Each tree has its own buffer pool and I/O; a per-tree DiskIOUring keeps I/O completions local and avoids cross-tree coordination. The DiskIOUring does no application logic — only CQE dispatch. |
| D-Async3 | **`eventfd` for Rust↔C++ notification.** | Simplest kernel-level notification: one `write(8 bytes)` wakes Tokio's `AsyncFd`. Level-triggered, no missed events. Falls back to a pipe + `kqueue` on macOS. |
| D-Async4 | **macOS dev path: in-memory store, no io_uring.** | io_uring is Linux-only. For dev/testing on macOS, the in-memory store completes synchronously (fast path only). Production runs on Linux with real io_uring. |

## 4. Rust-Side `KVEngine` Async Trait Shape

> **Merged from `design-crowdb-kv-async-kvengine.md` (2026-07).**
> **Status:** implemented (landed 2026-07-09).
> This section records the design of the Rust-side `KVEngine` trait's async
> shape (`KVFuture<T>`) and why it looks the way it does, kept as the
> rationale record for a decision that is easy to get wrong (the naive
> `async-trait` conversion), not as a live plan.

### 4.1 The Problem

`KVEngine` is consumed as `Box<dyn KVEngine>` (`PxLearner::engine`), chosen at
runtime via a CLI flag (`--kv-engine {memory,crowdb-tree}`). Its `get`/`scan`/
`apply` need an async-capable return type so that a genuine I/O path
(crowdb-tree demand-load miss, served by the io_uring engine, §3 "Async FFI
Bridge") can suspend instead of blocking a Tokio worker thread on a
synchronous `pread`. That is the exact anti-pattern the DiskIOUring exists to
avoid at the C++/FFI layer, which would otherwise resurface immediately one
layer up in Rust.

### 4.2 The Central Tension: `dyn KVEngine` vs. `async fn` in Traits

Native `async fn` in traits is **not `dyn`-compatible**. Three ways to square
that with runtime engine selection:

| Option | Cost |
| --- | --- |
| **(a) `async-trait` crate** | Boxes every async call into a `Pin<Box<dyn Future>>` via macro, one heap allocation **per call, including the fast in-memory path with no I/O**. Undoes the DiskIOUring's "fast path costs nothing" property one layer up. |
| **(b) Generic `PxLearner<E: KVEngine>`** | Zero overhead, but `E` would need to propagate through `PxLocalReplica`, `PxGroup`, `PxKvStore`, and `DashMap<GroupId, PxGroup>`, too invasive for an engine chosen at runtime. |
| **(c) Hybrid fast-path/slow-path future (chosen)** | Plain (non-`async`) `fn`s return a small custom future enum that resolves immediately (no allocation) for the fast path and only boxes a real future for the rare slow (I/O) path. Fully `dyn`-compatible; mirrors the exact fast/slow split the C++ layer already makes. |

### 4.3 `KVFuture<T>` and the Trait Shape

```rust
pub enum KVFuture<T> {
    Ready(Option<T>),                              // taken on first poll; re-polling panics
    Pending(Pin<Box<dyn Future<Output = T> + Send>>),
}

impl<T> KVFuture<T> {
    pub fn ready(v: T) -> Self { KVFuture::Ready(Some(v)) }
}

pub trait KVEngine: Send + Sync {
    fn apply(&self, slot: u64, batch: &Batch) -> KVFuture<()>;
    fn get(&self, key: &[u8]) -> KVFuture<Option<(u64, Vec<u8>)>>;
    fn scan(&self, prefix: &[u8], limit: usize) -> KVFuture<(Vec<(Vec<u8>, u64, Vec<u8>)>, bool)>;
    // iter_all / clear / compare / resume_from_slot /
    // persist_snapshot / set_gc_watermark / collect_garbage: plain sync fns.
    // Diagnostic/maintenance-path only (compare/iter_all: tests + snapshot
    // export; the rest: restore path + the periodic group-maintenance
    // task), never on the hot Paxos-accept / crowdb-rpc-read path, so a brief
    // blocking call there is an acceptable trade-off.
}
```

`Ready` costs nothing beyond the enum tag + inline value, no allocation, no
`Pin<Box<..>>`. `InMemKV` always returns `Ready`. `CrowdbTreeEngine::get`
(`lib/crowdb-kv/src/kv/crowdb_tree_engine.rs`) does the same fast-path check the C++
layer does first, via `crowdb_tree_ffi::AsyncCrowdbtree::try_get`; on a resident
hit/miss it returns `Ready` at zero extra cost, and only on a genuine
demand-load miss does it construct `Pending`, wrapping the DiskIOUring-driven
future `try_get` already builds. `CrowdbTreeEngine::scan`/`apply` always
resolve `Ready` today (no async `scan`/`apply` C API exists yet, an honest
gap, not an oversight; see `CrowdbTreeEngine`'s doc comment).

### 4.4 Caller-Side Wiring

`Learner::learn` is a native `async fn` (mirroring `Acceptor`'s existing
`async fn accept`/`prepare` convention; neither trait is ever used as
`dyn`, so native `async fn` is safe for both). `PxLearner::apply_entry`/
`engine_get`/`engine_scan` are `async fn` and `.await` the `KVFuture`
directly. `PxLocalReplica::learn_chosen`/`apply_committed_up_to` and
`PxKvStore::kv_get`/`kv_scan` were already `async fn` (already awaited by
every caller) and now genuinely `.await` a future that can suspend, instead
of always resolving on the first poll.

`engine_scan`/`apply_entry` stay `async fn` for signature uniformity with
`engine_get`, but never actually suspend today, matching §4.3's note that
`scan`/`apply` have no async C API yet.

### 4.5 Testing

- `kv/kv_future_test.rs`: `KVFuture::ready(v)` polls to `Ready(v)` on the
  first poll without registering a waker; a `Pending` variant polls through
  to the wrapped future's result; polling a completed `Ready` again panics.
- `InMemKV` regression guard (`mem_kv_test.rs`): every call returns `Ready`
  (asserted via `matches!`, not just the unwrapped value, so an accidental
  switch to `Pending` fails loudly here first).
- `CrowdbTreeEngine` regression tests (`crowdb_tree_engine_test.rs`): a resident
  hit/miss returns `Ready`; `get_constructs_pending_for_genuine_demand_load_miss`
  evicts a durable engine's resident leaf and asserts `get` returns `Pending`
  and resolves to the right value.
- `paxos/learner_async_test.rs`: the same fast/slow property one layer up,
  through `PxLearner::engine_get`.
