# New Requirements — Backlog & Analysis

Forward-looking implementation items. Each item is classified by priority,
complexity, and dependency. Before implementation, follow the
[Implementation Process](#implementation-process) below.

---

## Item Index

**Next R number: R53** — Bump this line in the same commit when adding a new item.

### High Priority

*(none currently)*

### Medium Priority

**Complexity — Medium:**
- **[R32](R32-kv-custom-rust-rpc.md)** — Custom Rust RPC library to replace gRPC on the hot path — Area:
  RPC / consensus — gRPC (tonic + h2) serializes concurrent writers on a
  connection-level userspace lock (HPACK table, frame buffer,
  flow-control windows); measured cost is ~17% at 2T:1C, zero at
  1T:1C. A custom `[len][req_id][protobuf]`-over-raw-TCP transport
  removes the userspace funnel — the kernel TCP lock is the only
  serialization point. **Deferred until** read throughput is the
  primary constraint AND the h2 lock is profiled as the hot spot; until
  then write-path (R16a/R17) and disk-I/O work take precedence.
  High complexity (2–4K lines: framing, pool, reconnect, timeout,
  cancellation, backpressure, TLS). Scope is the internal
  replica-to-replica path only; management API stays on Axum/HTTP.
  Reference implementations: protosocket (Momento), Volo (CloudWeGo),
  Cap'n Proto RPC.
- **[R33](R33-crow-tree-rename.md)** — Extract crow-tree to separate repo and rename — Area:
  workspace — Move `crowtree/` into its own git repository (preserving
  history), wire `crow-kv` to depend on `crow-tree-ffi` as an external
  dependency, and rename the crate/namespace/macros from `crowtree` to
  `crow-tree` / `crow::tree` / `CROW_TREE_*`. Establishes the `crow-kv` →
  `crow-tree` dependency boundary analogous to `crow-kv` → `crow-common`.
  Most naturally done after R12.
- **[R50](R50-epoch-protected-memtable.md)** — Epoch-protected
  lock-free MemTable — Area: scan / get / crow-tree engine —
  **Done.** `MemTable::snapshot()` deep-copied every live L0 entry
  (key + full cell payload) on every scan regardless of range or
  `limit`, and an L0 `get` hit copied twice. Root cause: L0 was the
  only reader-visible structure outside the engine's EBR scheme.
  Replaced the `absl::btree_map` under `mu_` with a
  `ConcurrentSkipList` (inline keys, versioned cell pointers,
  epoch-deferred reclamation). Readers now traverse L0 lock-free
  under their existing epoch guard with zero copy; the cursor seeks
  directly (no `upper_bound` skip pass); `get_view` borrows the
  cell directly off the node. Closes the known gap at
  `crow-tree.h:81`. All 383 `test-tree-ct` tests pass.

### Low Priority

**Complexity — Low (placeholder):**
- **[R5](R5-rdma-alloc.md)** — RDMA-pinned allocation — Blocked by: RDMA backend — Area: crowtree
  engine — `buffer::allocate` seam is designed for RDMA-pinned memory but no
  RDMA backend exists yet; placeholder only.

**Complexity — Medium:**
- **[R4](R4-bounded-mempool.md)** — Bounded memory pool — Area: crowtree engine — `buffer::allocate` uses
  unbounded `std::malloc`; a burst of large writes can spike RSS without
  backpressure.
- **[R52](R52-reverse-scan.md)** — Reverse scan — Area: scan / crow-tree
  engine — `scan` is forward-only today (ascending key order). Reverse
  scan (descending order, `start_before` instead of `start_after`) is a
  distinct cost shape: the B+tree descent targets the leaf containing
  `start_before`, the merge loop walks cursors backward, and the
  `LeafChainCursor` needs a reverse seek/advance. The skip-list L0
  cursor (R50) is forward-only — a reverse cursor would need
  `prev()` links or a separate reverse traversal path. Client API:
  `KvScanRequest` gains a `direction` field; the S3-style pagination
  uses the first key of each page as the next `start_before`. Needs
  its own scan perf baseline (reverse scans have different cache
  behavior — backward leaf traversal touches pages in reverse
  allocation order).

## Implementation Process

Each item follows the lifecycle defined in the
[`/implement-requirement` workflow](../../.devin/workflows/implement-requirement.md):
understand → design → plan → implement → merge design → cleanup.

After the PR is merged, all obsolete working docs (design draft, plan doc)
must be deleted — see the workflow's Post-merge cleanup section.
