# New Requirements — Backlog & Analysis

Forward-looking implementation items. Each item is classified by priority,
complexity, and dependency. Before implementation, follow the
[Implementation Process](#implementation-process) below.

---

## Item Index

**Next R number: R67** — Bump this line in the same commit when adding a new item.

### High Priority

- **[R66](R66-kv-wal-io-uring.md)** — WAL io_uring backend — eliminate
  `spawn_blocking` on the durability path. The WAL's production I/O
  backend (`File` / `BlockDevice`) routes `fdatasync` and file writes
  through `tokio::fs` / `std::fs`, both of which use `spawn_blocking`
  internally (thread hop + blocking pool saturation under burst load).
  Add `IoBackend::Uring` variant that reuses the crow-tree C++ reactor
  (`lib/crow-tree/src/reactor.cpp`, already proven for B-tree page I/O)
  for WAL segment I/O via `io_uring` SQE/CQE. Expose the reactor's
  submit API (`submit_read`/`submit_write`/`submit_fsync`) via FFI as
  Rust async functions. `WalFileInner::Uring` implements all `WalFile`
  operations via reactor SQEs — no `spawn_blocking`, no thread hop.
  Fallback to `File` on non-Linux / no-liburing. `O_DIRECT` aligned
  writes. No `pipeline_writer` or `segment` API changes (drop-in async
  fn replacement). Linux + liburing only; tests skip on other platforms.

### Medium Priority

**Complexity — Medium:**
- **[R32](R32-kv-custom-rust-rpc.md)** — Custom Rust RPC library to replace gRPC on the hot path — Area:
  RPC / consensus — gRPC (tonic + h2) serializes concurrent writers on a
  connection-level userspace lock (HPACK table, frame buffer,
  flow-control windows); measured cost is ~17% at 2T:1C, zero at
  1T:1C. A custom `[len][req_id][protobuf]`-over-raw-TCP transport
  removes the userspace funnel — the kernel TCP lock is the only
  serialization point. **Deferred until** read throughput is the
  primary constraint AND the h2 lock is profiled as the hot spot; until
  then write-path (R16a/R17) and disk-I/O work take precedence.
  High complexity (2–4K lines: framing, pool, reconnect, timeout,
  cancellation, backpressure, TLS). Scope is the internal
  replica-to-replica path only; management API stays on Axum/HTTP.
  Reference implementations: protosocket (Momento), Volo (CloudWeGo),
  Cap'n Proto RPC.
- **[R33](R33-crow-tree-rename.md)** — Extract crow-tree to separate repo and rename — Area:
  workspace — Move `crowtree/` into its own git repository (preserving
  history), wire `crow-kv` to depend on `crow-tree-ffi` as an external
  dependency, and rename the crate/namespace/macros from `crowtree` to
  `crow-tree` / `crow::tree` / `CROW_TREE_*`. Establishes the `crow-kv` →
  `crow-tree` dependency boundary analogous to `crow-kv` → `crow-common`.
  Most naturally done after R12.
- **[R50](R50-epoch-protected-memtable.md)** — Epoch-protected
  lock-free MemTable — Area: scan / get / crow-tree engine —
  **Done.** `MemTable::snapshot()` deep-copied every live L0 entry
  (key + full cell payload) on every scan regardless of range or
  `limit`, and an L0 `get` hit copied twice. Root cause: L0 was the
  only reader-visible structure outside the engine's EBR scheme.
  Replaced the `absl::btree_map` under `mu_` with a
  `ConcurrentSkipList` (inline keys, versioned cell pointers,
  epoch-deferred reclamation). Readers now traverse L0 lock-free
  under their existing epoch guard with zero copy; the cursor seeks
  directly (no `upper_bound` skip pass); `get_view` borrows the
  cell directly off the node. Closes the known gap at
  `crow-tree.h:81`. All 383 `test-tree-ct` tests pass.

### Low Priority

**Complexity — Low (placeholder):**
- **[R5](R5-rdma-alloc.md)** — RDMA-pinned allocation — Blocked by: RDMA backend — Area: crowtree
  engine — `buffer::allocate` seam is designed for RDMA-pinned memory but no
  RDMA backend exists yet; placeholder only.

**Complexity — Medium:**
- **[R4](R4-bounded-mempool.md)** — Bounded memory pool — Area: crowtree engine — `buffer::allocate` uses
  unbounded `std::malloc`; a burst of large writes can spike RSS without
  backpressure.
- **[R52](R52-reverse-scan.md)** — Reverse scan — Area: scan / crow-tree
  engine — `scan` is forward-only today (ascending key order). Reverse
  scan (descending order, `start_before` instead of `start_after`) is a
  distinct cost shape: the B+tree descent targets the leaf containing
  `start_before`, the merge loop walks cursors backward, and the
  `LeafChainCursor` needs a reverse seek/advance. The skip-list L0
  cursor (R50) is forward-only — a reverse cursor would need
  `prev()` links or a separate reverse traversal path. Client API:
  `KvScanRequest` gains a `direction` field; the S3-style pagination
  uses the first key of each page as the next `start_before`. Needs
  its own scan perf baseline (reverse scans have different cache
  behavior — backward leaf traversal touches pages in reverse
  allocation order).
- **[R54](R54-kv-scan-engine-profiling.md)** — Scan engine profiling —
  Area: scan / crow-tree engine — both read modes saturate near ~38k
  scans/s at 32T:32C; the bottleneck moved to the C++ crow-tree merge
  loop (L0 skip-list + L1 B+tree cursor) but the specific hot spot is
  unknown. Add `tools/profile-scan.sh` (mirroring
  `tools/profile-write.sh`), profile the 32T:32C scan bench, and
  document the top hot stacks. Investigation only — no scan-path code
  changes. If a clear optimization target emerges, file a follow-up
  requirement with the profiling evidence. Low complexity.
- **[R55](R55-kv-scan-carry-read-slot.md)** — Carry page-1 `read_slot`
  forward as `min_slot` — Area: scan / client — a multi-page
  linearizable scan pays the read barrier once per page
  (`px_kv_store.rs:183`), but only the first page needs a freshness
  proof; later pages only need to be at least as fresh as page 1. After
  page 1 returns `read_slot = S`, switch subsequent pages to `MinSlot`
  with `min_slot = S` — the store serves locally when
  `contiguous_applied >= S` (`px_kv_store.rs:575`), skipping the
  barrier, and redirects to the leader only if the chosen replica
  hasn't caught up. No proto change (`read_slot`/`min_slot` fields
  already exist); client-local. Semantics unchanged (a paginated scan
  was never a single snapshot). Low–medium complexity.
- **[R56](R56-kv-scan-end-key-bound.md)** — Optional exclusive `end_key`
  range bound — Area: scan / kv — `KvScanRequest` has `prefix` +
  `start_after` but no upper bound, so an arbitrary `[start, end)` range
  cannot be expressed without client-side over-read and filtering. Add
  an optional exclusive `end_key` (empty = unbounded) to proto, engine
  merge-loop early-stop (mirrors the existing prefix stop at
  `crow-tree.cpp:1964`), FFI, store, service, and client. One new field
  per layer, mechanical. Prerequisite shape for R52 reverse scan.
  Low–medium complexity.
- **[R57](R57-tree-scan-zero-copy-staging.md)** — Zero-copy engine scan
  result staging — Area: scan / crow-tree engine — each scan page is
  copied 3 times before the FFI boundary: `consider` lambda stages into
  `std::vector<scan_entry>` (`crow-tree.cpp:1853/1868`), `ct_scan`
  re-packs into `std::string packed` (`c_api.cpp:912-920`), `make_buf`
  mallocs+memcpys again (`c_api.cpp:43/921`). ~10.5 MiB memcpy per full
  3.5 MiB page. Fix: pack the wire format directly in `consider` (single
  growing buffer) and transfer ownership across the FFI via the
  `make_borrowed_buf` pattern already used by the get fast path. Collapses
  3 copies to 1 (the unavoidable wire-format assembly). Design-level
  redundancy, not profiling-guided. Medium complexity.
- **[R58](R58-tree-scan-merge-loop-fast-path.md)** — Merge loop 2-source
  fast path + loser tree — Area: scan / crow-tree engine — the merge loop
  does 2 × N_sources byte-wise compares per output entry
  (`crow-tree.cpp:1890-1934`): a min-key scan then a winner pass. The
  common case (1 active L0 + L1, no frozen memtables) is a trivial 2-way
  min needing 1 compare, not a 2-pass vector scan. Add a 2-source fast
  path branch; for k > 2 (several frozen memtables) use a loser tree
  (O(log k) per merge). Add `__builtin_prefetch` for the next skip-list
  node and right-sibling leaf. Design-level redundancy (k-way merge has a
  known O(log k) structure). Medium complexity.
- **[R59](R59-kv-snapshot-scan.md)** — Two scan modes + snapshot
  versioning API — Area: scan / kv / crow-tree engine — the current
  `scan` is the only range-read surface (S3-list semantics: per-page
  consistent, not cross-page). R59 formalizes two modes: (1) **list
  scan** — the existing `scan`, fast, latest values, for interactive
  listing; (2) **snapshot versioning API** — flush + `snapshot_view()`
  (already built, pins L1 at `last_applied_slot`, zero-copy page
  refcounts) + iterate the frozen vector with prefix/pagination. New
  RPCs: `CreateSnapshot`/`ListSnapshots`/`SnapshotScan`/
  `ReleaseSnapshot` + management API for `SetGcWatermark`. No new engine
  machinery (no version chain, no L0 pinning — flush drains L0 first).
  Active snapshots protect pinned pages from GC via refcount. Medium
  complexity.
- **[R60](R60-tree-scan-sibling-leaf-readahead.md)** — Sibling-leaf
  readahead on cold scans — Area: scan / crow-tree engine — the scan
  path demand-loads each L1 leaf inline (sync) or one pending page per
  reactor round trip (async), so a cold multi-leaf range pays one
  stall/round-trip per leaf, serialized with merge work on prior
  leaves. The scan knows `right_sibling` (`crow-tree.cpp:1822/2074`)
  before finishing the current leaf — issue a readahead for the next
  leaf to overlap I/O with merging. Sync path: prefetch the
  right-sibling page id via a page-cache async-resolve seam. Async
  path: batch the right-sibling read with the current leaf's read in
  the reactor submission (small readahead window, default 1). Win is
  zero on mem-mode (leaves resident); needs a cold/disk bench config to
  validate. Medium complexity.
- **[R61](R61-kv-scan-keys-only-projection.md)** — Keys-only /
  count-only projection — Area: scan / kv / crow-tree engine — scans
  always materialize and ship values, including the expensive
  `assemble_overflow_value` overflow-chain assembly
  (`crow-tree.cpp:1857-1858`). A `keys_only` flag skips value
  materialization in the `consider` lambda (stages key only) and
  shrinks pages by the value fraction; a `count_only` variant counts
  matches and ships zero items. One new flag per layer (proto, engine,
  FFI, store, service, client). Useful for key listing, prefix
  cardinality, and the console UI key browser. Low–medium complexity.
- **[R62](R62-kv-scan-deadline-cancellation.md)** — Per-scan deadline /
  cancellation — Area: scan / kv / crow-tree engine — no per-scan
  timeout at any layer; an unbounded `limit=0` scan runs until the
  transport gives up, and the engine merge loop
  (`crow-tree.cpp:1890`) has no cancellation check between leaves. Add
  a `deadline_ms` proto field (absolute unix-ms; 0 = no deadline) and
  periodic deadline checks: client pagination loop checks before
  fetching the next page (returns partial + `timed_out` flag); engine
  merge loop checks once per leaf (in `refill_l1`) and breaks early
  with `truncated = true`. Bounds worst-case server work. Medium
  complexity.

## Implementation Process

Each item follows the lifecycle defined in the
[`/implement-requirement` workflow](../../.devin/workflows/implement-requirement.md):
understand → design → plan → implement → merge design → cleanup.

After the PR is merged, all obsolete working docs (design draft, plan doc)
must be deleted — see the workflow's Post-merge cleanup section.
