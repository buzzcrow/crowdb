# CROW Documentation Index

One-line pointer to every doc and section. Read this first; open the listed
doc only when a task touches a topic in its row.

## Top-Level Docs

| Doc | When to read |
| --- | --- |
| `design/kv/design-crow-kv.md` | Root KV design document: what CROW is, why key choices were made, architecture overview, data model, read modes, consensus/storage/lifecycle/client interaction, module decomposition, crate layout, concurrency model. Read first for any design or architecture question. |
| `user-manual/user-guide.md` | User guide: three interfaces (Web UI, CLI, REST API), quick start (bootstrap a 3-node cluster), KV operations, cluster management (health, add/remove replicas, replace nodes), rolling upgrade, emergency procedures, backup, and full CLI + REST API reference. Run `python3 doc/user-manual/build_html.py` to generate `user-guide.html` with tabbed CLI/curl examples. |

## Sub-Designs (`design/{kv,tree,console}/`)

### KV — Consensus

| Doc | Read when working on |
| --- | --- |
| `design/kv/design-crow-kv-leader-election.md` | Term/ballot bridge, election protocol, new-leader bulk Phase 1, heartbeats, leader lease, ReadIndex, step-down. |
| `design/kv/design-crow-kv-slot.md` | Parallel slot pipelining (§1–§14): sliding window, gap detection/repair, safe-slot, per-key resolved-slot, correctness analysis, linearizability proof. Concurrent sparse slot list (§15–§22): `SlotList<T>`, chunk layout, trim/GC, reclamation. Server-side proposal coalescing (§23): R36 timer → R45 event → R45b drain threshold, micro-batcher, dedup tag threading, config, correctness, benchmark results. |
| `design/kv/design-crow-kv-rpc.md` | Wire protocol design: classic Paxos message surface, LearnerStream bidi stream (why dedicated stream, flow control, parallelism), PxService, version compatibility, Paxos error model (§7). Cluster discovery is HTTP, not gRPC. |
| `design/kv/design-crow-kv-reconfiguration.md` | Direct per-node mutation model, member add/remove, leader transfer, `membership_epoch` fence, safety argument, design history. Applies to all groups including system group (group 0). |
| `design/kv/design-crow-kv-state-machine.md` | Storage plug-in: per-key slot tracking, apply semantics, snapshot, compaction, compare, engine impls. |

### KV — Storage

| Doc | Read when working on |
| --- | --- |
| `design/kv/design-crow-kv-wal.md` | Write-ahead log: multi-disk segments, backend-neutral durable flush, ack contract, replay/restore/recovery, GC, disk loss. |
| `design/kv/design-crow-kv-server.md` | `crow-kv-server` binary: KV engine selection, startup ordering (§2.2: `node-config.json` auto-restore + group 0 reconciliation), concurrency model, HTTP management API design (axum, §2.4: system group endpoints `/system/init`, `/topology/finalize`, `/topology/ready`), group lifecycle, shutdown, port pool. |

### Tree — Storage Engine

| Doc | Read when working on |

| `design/tree/design-crow-tree-engine.md` | crow-tree in-memory engine: slot cell, pages/delta records, write path (apply→delta→consolidate→split/merge), versioned root (`RootVersion`), tree-owned lock-free epoch reclamation, read path, concurrency invariants; the `buffer` memory-ownership model (owned/borrowed, SBO, zero-copy write/read pipelines); the io_uring async FFI bridge (reactor, `ct_future`, fast/slow path); Rust-side `KVEngine` async trait shape (`KVFuture<T>`, §4). |
| `design/tree/design-crow-tree-storage.md` | crow-tree durable storage: `PageStore` backends (`TextPageStore` debug text files, `BlockPageStore` array-of-blocks / O_DIRECT), zero-copy slotted frame format, buffer pool (frame arena, CLOCK eviction, epoch-safe reuse), internal-WAL decision, snapshot pipeline + recovery + export/import, mapping table (PID indirection, segment persistence/recycling), GC watermarks + consensus-WAL GC coupling, new-member install. |

### KV — Cross-Cutting

| --- | --- |
| `design/kv/design-crow-kv-test.md` | Test strategy, layer scope definitions, coverage rules per layer, tiered strategy for Group/Store/Deployment/UI E2E layers, console mgmt API layer, crow-tree C++ test layers, benchmark layer (lifecycle, storage modes, write-only design, baseline results), feature-dependent test gaps. Read when designing tests or deciding where a test belongs. |
| `design/kv/design-crow-kv-observability.md` | Metrics module design: five metric types (Counter, Gauge, Bandwidth, LatencyHistogram, LatencySummary), registry lifecycle, naming convention, instrumentation points, system metrics collector, log file format, in-memory snapshot access, FFI boundary. Read when working on metrics or observability. |

## How AI Should Use This Index

1. Match the task description to a row above.
2. Open only the matched doc. For docs with sections, jump to the listed §
   via grep instead of reading top-to-bottom.
3. If unsure between two docs, prefer the most specific one
   (`design/{kv,tree,console}/design-crow-*.md` over `design/kv/design-crow-kv.md`).
4. If the task spans multiple sub-designs, open `design/kv/design-crow-kv.md` first to learn
   how they interact, then drill into specifics.
5. After the task: if the index row is now wrong (renamed file, materially
   changed scope), update this file in the same commit.
