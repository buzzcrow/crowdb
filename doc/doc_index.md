## How AI Should Use This Index

1. Match the task description to a row above.
2. Open only the matched doc; grep for the relevant `##` section instead of reading top-to-bottom.
3. If unsure between two docs, prefer the most specific sub-design over the root design.
4. If the task spans multiple sub-designs, open the root design first to learn how they interact.
5. After the task: if the index row is now wrong (renamed file, materially changed scope), update this file in the same commit.
