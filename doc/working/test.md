# CROWDB Test Task Backlog

<!-- DO NOT DELETE THIS FILE — it is a persistent backlog, not a per-task draft. -->

**Override:** This file is **persistent** — it is not deleted after the
requirement (R9) is complete. Only completed tasks are removed; the file
itself remains as the ongoing test task backlog. This overrides the
`/implement-requirement` workflow's cleanup step which would normally delete
`plan-<topic>.md`.

Unfinished test tasks, grouped by layer. Each task has a checkbox for tracking.
For test strategy, layer scope, and coverage details, see [`design/kv/design-crowdb-kv-test.md`](../design/kv/design-crowdb-kv-test.md).

## Suite Timing

Each platform section keeps one row per test package and only the latest run.
Leave unexecuted packages in place with `—`; record elapsed time in seconds.

The measurement helper writes logs and aggregate results below
`.crowdb-runtime/artifacts/measure-tests/`. Keep slow individual-test notes next
to the component measurement that produced them.

Remaining action item from the macOS full-suite runs:

- [ ] `test-iceberg-sdk`: Maven `dependency:go-offline` stayed idle for more
  than eight minutes on macOS; rerun when the pinned dependency cache is
  available.

The complete macOS UI package now passes all 63 tests, including the 23-node
topology setup and the three-node KV/S3/Iceberg data flow.

## WAL Subsystem

Source: `lib/crowdb-kv/src/wal/`. Tests: 12 files, ~92 tests.

- [ ] **WAL disk-loss recovery (full fail-out)**: the full fail-out procedure
  (step-out RPC + reconfiguration, `design-crowdb-kv-wal.md` §8.1) is not yet
  implemented. The test should verify the node fails out of the group and
  rejoins via snapshot install after the disk is replaced. **Blocked** on the
  fail-out feature landing.

## Store

Source: `lib/crowdb-kv/src/store/`. Tests: 8 files, 26 tests.

- [ ] **Per-group WAL disk isolation**: `WalConfig.wal_disks` is per-`WalEngine`,
  not per-group within a store — the server startup path
  (`create_group_with_wal`) derives `wal_disks` from the store-level config, so
  groups cannot be assigned different physical disks. **Blocked** on a
  store-level config change to support per-group `wal_disks` override.

## Deployment

Source: `app/crowdb-kv-server/`. Tests: 9 files.

- [ ] **Network partition between processes**: verify cluster behavior when
  network connectivity between processes is severed and restored. **Blocked**:
  no network partition simulation infrastructure exists in the testkit.
  Needs a partition/drop mechanism (e.g. a proxy layer or toxiproxy-style
  interceptor) before the test can be written.
