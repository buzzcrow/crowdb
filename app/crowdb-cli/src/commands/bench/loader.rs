//! Shared loader-loop helper for tokio-based bench workloads.
//!
//! `run_workload` spawns `num_loaders` async tasks, each looping the
//! supplied `op` closure until a deadline, plus one timer task that
//! flips a shared `running` flag. The closure receives the shared
//! [`BenchRecorder`] and records each op's latency / errors itself.
//! The coroutine RPC path does not use this (the C++ `co_spawn` manages
//! its own loop); it records into a `BenchRecorder` directly from the
//! `on_response` callback.
//!
//! `BenchRecorder` wraps the project's `Counter` + `LatencyHistogram` +
//! `Bandwidth` handles from `crowdb_common::metrics`, all registered on
//! the `MetricsRunner`'s registry. The `LatencyHistogram` tracks both
//! window state (flushed/reset each interval for the periodic metrics
//! log) and cumulative state (never reset, for the final JSON report)
//! in a single `observe()` call — no double recording. Its `count` is
//! the success-ops count, so a separate success counter is not needed.
