//! Leader-election surface of [`PxGroup`].
//!
//! This module defines the [`LeaderElection`] trait and implements it for
//! [`PxGroup`]. All election lifecycle methods (driver spawn, per-tenure
//! cancel, proposing-term stamp, bulk Phase-1 repair sweep) live here so
//! the group module proper can stay focused on Paxos proposer logic and
//! membership bookkeeping.
//!
//! The trait is intentionally not object-safe (uses `self: &Arc<Self>` and
//! `async fn`); it exists to group the election API into a single
//! discoverable surface and to encourage other call sites to depend on
//! the trait rather than directly on `PxGroup`.
