        // - `apply` uses highest-slot-wins per key, so out-of-order replay
        //   still produces the correct final KV state.
        // - `update_frontier` handles out-of-order slots via the
        //   `out_of_order` BTreeMap, so watermarks stay correct even with
        //   gaps.
        // - NoOp entries (empty payload) are skipped by `apply_entry` and
        //   do not corrupt the KV state.
        //
        // If the engine reported a resume floor (`resume_from > 0`), skip
        // re-`learn`ing that prefix and start the walk at `resume_from +
        // 1` -- always, even if the term at `resume_from` can't be
        // recovered below. This is not just an optimization: an engine with
        // its own internal durable-floor gate (e.g. crow-tree's
        // `MemTable::durable_floor`, set from `resume_from_slot`'s exact
        // value at `flush` time) rejects *any* write at `slot <= floor`
        // regardless of key -- stronger than the per-key highest-slot-wins
        // `KVEngine::apply` documents -- so re-attempting a write below the
