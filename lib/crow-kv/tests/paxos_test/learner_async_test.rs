//! Regression gate for the deferred
//! caller-side conversion: proves `PxLearner::engine_get` genuinely awaits
//! through a real `KVFuture::Pending` end-to-end, not just that
//! `CrowTreeEngine::get` constructs one in isolation
//! (`kv/crow_tree_engine_test.rs`'s `get_constructs_pending_for_genuine_demand_load_miss`
//! covers that layer). This is the test the design doc's §6 explicitly
//! deferred adding until `PxLearner` actually had an `async fn` to test.
