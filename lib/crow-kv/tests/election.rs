//! Leader-election unit tests.
//!
//! Entrypoint for isolated unit tests of the election state machine on
//! [`PxLocalReplica`]: role transitions (`become_follower` /
//! `become_precandidate` / `become_candidate` / `become_leader`), vote
//! granting rules (`PreVote` / `RequestVote`), heartbeat handler, lease
//! management, and term fencing.
//!
//! These tests drive a single replica in isolation — no peers, no group,
//! no gRPC. Multi-replica election convergence lives in the `group` binary;
//! the replica-layer persistence / prepare-accept / dedup / snapshot tests
//! live in the `replica` binary.
