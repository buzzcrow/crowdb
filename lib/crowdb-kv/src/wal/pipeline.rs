//! `WalPipeline` — single-disk WAL pipeline state.
//!
//! Each pipeline owns one active (unsealed) segment on one disk. The
//! `WalEngine` holds a vector of pipelines and distributes records across
//! them via slot affinity.
//!
//! The pipeline is a thin handle: it holds the command channel sender to
//! the dedicated writer task. The writer task owns the `WalSegment`
//! exclusively.
