    // longer accepts writes) and a fresh, empty MemTable takes over as
    // active_; the frozen table is drained into L1 by flush() (explicit call
    // from the upper-layer maintenance loop). This bounds how large any *one*
    // buffer can grow and lets new writes proceed without contending with an
    // in-progress drain (they land in a different MemTable object entirely).
    // This is the count of buffers total: 1 active_ + up to
    // (max_memtable_count - 1) queued frozen buffers. Must be >= 2 (2 = the
    // common active_/flushing_ case); values are not currently validated by
    // the engine. When the frozen queue is already at (max_memtable_count -
    // 1), a further threshold-triggered freeze is skipped (active_ is allowed
    // to keep growing past its threshold) rather than stalling the writer --
    // an explicit flush() is expected to catch up and free a slot. See
    // Crowdbtree's active_/frozen_ member comment for the full design,
    // including how non-contiguous (slot > the current contiguous frontier)
    // leftovers are handled when a frozen buffer is drained.

    // this through as the runtime segment size) -- present now so
    // callers/tests can start tuning it ahead of that wiring.

    // any tree that never calls the *_async methods) means get_async's
    // genuine-miss case and flush_async/snapshot_async fall back to
    // completing synchronously in the caller's stack frame instead of
    // touching a uring -- no MemAsyncPageStore needed
    // (see Crowdbtree::get_async's doc comment). One DiskIOUring per Crowdbtree

    // ([algo][raw_len][stored_len][crc][stored]); the buffer pool always holds
    // uncompressed frames. The algo is recorded per page, so a page is decoded
    // correctly regardless of the option in force when it is read back (mixed
    // pages across incremental snapshots decode fine). default_env kNone keeps the
