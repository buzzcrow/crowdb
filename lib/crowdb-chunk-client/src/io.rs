///   next push would not block, `Pause` if the writer is now at
///   capacity.
/// - `require_data` is a cheap non-async hint: `true` if `on_data`
///   would not block now.
/// - `on_finish` signals end of input: flush, seal, return
///   `Vec<Location>`.
/// - `on_error` aborts: return `Location`s of already-sealed chunks
///   for cleanup.
///
/// Two caller strategies (selected by `BackpressurePolicy` on the

/// - **Blocking**: ignore `require_data`, call `on_data` directly.
/// - **Non-blocking**: check `require_data()` first; if false, back
///   off (yield / return 503).
