//! Safe Rust async facade over the crow-rpc C ABI (R104).
//!
//! The C++ engine runs its own I/O threads; this crate is a thin async
//! facade that submits requests and awaits completions via oneshot
//! channels. The `call()` method returns a `impl Future` backed by a
//! `oneshot::Receiver` — tokio awaits it normally, `select!` and
//! cancellation work.
